In 2016, the company brought its total portfolio of clean, renewable energy to 10.4 GW of installed capacity by year-end, with the addition of 820 MW of new wind energy capacity. Of that capacity, 429 MW were added in the United States, our most important growth market; 200 MW in Mexico, which corresponds to our first project there; 120 MW in Brazil, which more than doubled our capacity in the country; and the remaining 72 MW in Europe. A total of 24.5 TWh of clean electricity was produced, avoiding the emission of about 20.1 million tons of CO2 and delivering on our commitment to conducting business in a way that contributes to a more sustainable planet. Over the course of 2016, EDPR reinforced its position as the growth driver within EDP Group as it contributes now to 32% of EDP Groupâ€™s recurrent EBITDA. We remain faithful to our focus on renewables, clearly a key solution to the global fight against climate change, among other side benefits. The political consensus around this topic has been to set a goal to limit global warming to 1.5Âº C. However, tangible initiatives are still missing to entirely tackle this enormous challenge. Currently only a small fraction of CO2 emissions worldwide are properly taxed. Even the EU Emissions Trading System is highly ineffective at encouraging changes to the energy mix given the oversupply of allowances that keep carbon prices too low. The economics of the sector have changed, we are moving from a variable-cost to a fixed-cost system, in which marginal pricing is no longer sufficient to incentivize investments, providing no clear long-term price signals incentives. The market must be redesigned and readapt in order to effectively promote the need for an increasing share of renewables in the energy mix. At current pool prices in wholesale markets, the sector does not offer the right economic incentives to invest, in renewables, nor in conventional sources. We believe that competition in the sector is important, but should be of a different nature, with ex-ante bidding in well-thought-out auctions for capacity, rather than ex-post marginal pricing in wholesale markets.  6  The turn towards renewables is inevitable. For instance, the EU aims to cut its total carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050, from 1990 levels. It already has binding emissionsâ€™ and renewablesâ€™ targets for 2020 and EU leaders have also committed to 2030 targets. We therefore remain confident in our vision of enduring opportunities with realistic value as the result of doing business on the right side of the energy sector. Last May, we updated our business plan through 2020. The companyâ€™s business case was set to remain supported in a clear strategic agenda over our distinctive three pillars: i) selective growth - on one side, prioritizing quality investments in our core markets (at about 700 MW per year versus 500 MW per year in the previous 2014-17 business plan), most of which have already secured high visibility over their returns through long-term contracts; and, on the other side, reinforcing our portfolio mix in new technologies, namely solar and wind offshore; ii) operational excellence â€“ maximizing electricity production by leveraging on our high technical expertise, and reach higher levels of availability of our assets and superior load factors in our current and new projects in particular, while further reducing our core opex per unit of capacity, consolidating our unique operation and maintenance capabilities; iii) self-funding business â€“ covering our â‚¬4.8 billion investment plan in the 2016-20 period, mainly from the retained cash flow from our assets, and this time only partly supplemented by our assetsâ€™ rotation program with an amount of up to â‚¬1.1 billion. Half of our target for the companyâ€™s assetsâ€™ rotation program has already been reached. The appetite for equity stakes in renewable energy projects is increasing among institutional investors, such as infrastructure and sovereign wealth funds, and the program outlined in our business plan is well ahead of schedule. The â‚¬550 million transaction we carried out in the middle of last year, involving a 49% stake in a portfolio of projects in Europe, took place at an attractive multiple of â‚¬1.7 million per MW.   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  This figure marks a clear indicator of the quality of the companyâ€™s assets and the success of our strategy to crystallize value and enhance profitable growth, under a balanced discipline of indebtedness. In addition, and in the context of the strategic partnership between EDP and China Three Gorges, another â‚¬363 million final consideration was settled in a transaction involving the sale to CTG of 49% of a portfolio of wind energy assets in Poland and Italy, bringing the cumulative amount raised by EDPR to â‚¬0.8 billion, since the programâ€™s establishment in late 2011. EBITDA reached â‚¬1,171 million in the 2016 financial year, while EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring items increased 12% year-on-year. On its turn, Net Income was â‚¬56 million, a 66% year-on-year decline due mostly to below average wind resources in the year and to favorable non-recurring events impacting the prior year and some unfavorable accounting impacts this year, yet having a positive outcome for the financial results in the immediate future. More importantly, Retained Cash Flow, the net cash flow generated by our assets and available either for reinvestment, debt reduction or distribution to the companyâ€™s shareholders, totalled â‚¬698 million in 2016, representing a 13% year-on-year increase.  tive, which set 10 principles in the areas of human rights, employment, environment and anti-corruption. The business plan defines explicit targets, setting a roadmap that brings together the three sustainability pillars and is laid down in ten different areas in line with the new UN Sustainable Development Goals through 2030. The action of the company is surely a keystone in the ongoing EDP Groupâ€™s high performance in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the Utilities Sector. I would like to express my gratitude for the full support of all the companyâ€™s corporate bodies, namely my fellow members of the Board of Directors, who provided the necessary challenge and drive for another successful year. Also, I would like to express our appreciation to all of those related to our company, in particular our shareholders and business partners comprising our landowners, suppliers, government entities and regulators. But most of all, I want to emphasize my gratitude for the hard work and dedication of our 1,083 employees worldwide who are the basis for our excellence in terms of operational performance and growth, therefore enhancing the success story that is EDPR.  Yours sincerely,  In light of this, it will be proposed at the General Shareholders Meeting to maintain the â‚¬0.05 per share dividend distribution, same as in the previous period, thus above the guided 25-35% range of consolidated net income, but representing only about 6% of total net cash generation. EDP RenovÃ¡veis is clear proof of how caring for the environment can lead to new profitable business models based on clean and carbon-free energy generation. Not just that, the company acts responsibly before all its stakeholders, as stated in its sustainable development principles and the public commitments that were underwritten, notably the United Nations Global Compact initia-  7   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  JoÃ£o Manso Neto Vice-chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO  8   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  Interview with the CEO  Q1 HOW SATISFIED ARE YOU WITH EDPRâ€™S 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS? Objectively, I would point out that at EDPR we have once again delivered a solid execution of the strategic agenda laid out in our 2016-20 business plan. That was demonstrated by our ability to reach most of our 2020 targets. We have added 820 MW of installed capacity to our portfolio, exceeding our 700 MW yearly average target, with an additional 248 MW under construction. Our total electricity production of 24.5 TWh represents a 14% increase and surpasses our 10% yearly growth target. EBITDA of â‚¬1.171 million increased by 12% adjusted for non-recurring items, above our yearly growth target. This performance was made possible by a positive contribution of â‚¬40 million in our electricity price hedges, which have very effectively sheltered our revenues from some unfavorable price movements in wholesale markets. It was also supported by a 5% reduction in the Core Opex/MW, in excess of our 1% reduction target. Our results could have been even better if wind resources had been closer to normal levels, but our average load factor fell 4% short of the P50 scenario in 2016, standing 11% below in the fourth quarter. Obviously, weather conditions are out of our control, but we are confident that wind resources always revert to its mean performance in the long-run. In contrast, something in which we have a degree of control is the energy availability of our assets where we keep delivering an outstanding performance of 97.7%, above our target of 97.5%. Our high-quality assets yielded â‚¬698 million of Retained Cash Flow, the net cash generated by our assets after remunerating the external sources of financing - namely debt, tax equity and asset rotation partners. The Retained Cash Flow is the amount available for reinvestment, deleveraging or distribution to our shareholders. This figure was 13% higher than the previous year, a fact that demonstrates our companyâ€™s solid growth profile. In 2016, under the rigor of our self-funded business model, we successfully cashed in a sizeable asset rotation deal of â‚¬550 million at an attractive multiple of â‚¬1.7 million per MW to further leverage the cash flow generation of our assets by fueling additional growth opportunities. Along the way, we are consistently lowering our cost of debt, which is currently at 4.0%, after restructuring and  prepaying about â‚¬2.3 billion since 2015, of which â‚¬0.9 billion this last year. In this process of optimizing our cost of debt, sometimes we end up having to write-down some items associated with the cancelled debt, negatively impacting our current net profit, yet clearly standing to benefit our future Net Income. For instance, in 2016, we incurred more than â‚¬25 million in such non-recurring expenses, and â‚¬8 million in the year before. Due to this process and other non-recurring items, along with a below-average wind resource, our reported Net Income of â‚¬56 million declined 66% in 2016. Yet, our Net Income adjusted was â‚¬104 million and this is grossly in line with the previous year adjusted for non-recurring events, namely the significant non-cash positive impact of the revaluation of some assets we acquired control of in Portugal that were previously jointly owned. I would like to reinforce that the decline in Net Income year-on-year is justified by non-recurrent short-term factors, which make sense from a long-term strategic perspective, since they will reduce our cost of debt and thereby improve future results. Q2 DO YOU MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF WIND ONSHORE EVEN WITHOUT INCENTIVES? Absolutely. The evidence is growing ever more indisputable. Recently, independent studies by industry experts showed that wind onshore technology has seen its â€œlevelized cost of energyâ€ - the all-in cost of building and operating a plant over its lifetime - drop by 66% since 2009, with an additional 26% decline expected by 2025. Wind onshore and solar photovoltaic are currently competitive with gas and coal-fired plants in many areas. Administratively set tariffs and other incentive-supporting mechanisms have played a role in fostering the deployment of renewables, allowing these technologies to progress and thus help bring costs down, in a virtuous cycle. However, the success of renewables in reaching higher penetration in the energy mix has created a vicious cycle of depressed power prices in wholesale markets, as those energy sources have almost zero marginal running costs after all, the wind and sun are free. Paradoxically, this creates a situation in which wholesale market prices continue to fall as more renewables are connected to the  9   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  grid. Without a new market model framework, investors will lack the incentives to take on the necessary investments. Wholesale prices in Europe dropped from about â‚¬80 per MWh in 2008 to â‚¬30-50 currently. Yet the solution, in our view, must not come from adding more subsidies to the system, but rather from fixing the currently dysfunctional power markets in a world that demands more renewables. Clearly, a system based on marginal costs is not adequate. We need long-term price certainty to incentivize up-front capital investment in the installation of renewable capacity. That is why we favor market competition for new capacity installations with reliable prices over the long run, avoiding exposure to variable wholesale prices. Market fixing should also come in the form of more effective pricing of CO2 emissions. Also essential are investments in power grids to better manage the intermittency of renewables, with more interconnectivity reaching longer distances and smarter adaptations to supply and demand. Q3 IF WIND ONSHORE IS TRULY COMPETITIVE, WHERE YOUâ€™RE ALREADY A KEY GLOBAL PLAYER, THEN WHY THE DIVERSIFICATION INTO SOLAR AND WIND OFFSHORE? Simply put, there are places where wind onshore is not viable or is less competitive than other energy sources, such as solar. This is true for France, due to a lack of both available territory and social acceptance of wind farms in the landscape. These factors account for the interest in wind offshore in the country. In the UK and other North Sea regions, wind offshore is also a strong industry that has attracted many interests given the rich wind offshore resources. The solar case is already valid in some regions of the US, such as California, or countries in southern Europe, where solar photovoltaic is more economical. We believe that solar technology and costs will continue to improve, and that solar and wind are set to become the two most competitive technologies. Therefore, we must be able to offer the best renewable technology for each market at each moment. This need explains our increased focus on solar, which will represent 10% of our capacity additions through 2020 according to our business plan, and our investment stake in developing wind offshore.  10  Moreover, many of our competitive advantages in wind onshore are replicable in wind offshore and solar photovoltaic technologies. Thatâ€™s another reason why it makes perfect sense. Q4 HAVE THE RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE US, CURRENTLY YOUR MOST IMPORTANT GROWTH MARKET, PROMPTED YOU TO CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY? Some concern about the USâ€™s new political landscape for renewables made a noticeable impact on our stock price performance since the last quarter of the year. We always act as takers of the political choices made by voters and citizens, and we never speak out publicly about governing bodies of countries where we operate. Nonetheless, we feel certain that the business case remains strong and see no reason to change course in our strategy to consider the US our core growth market. In recent Senate hearings, the new Secretary of the Treasury voiced his support of the current Production Tax Credit scheme. This reaffirms the phase-out of PTCs, approved in 2015, that enjoyed bipartisan support in a Republican-majority Congress. In the US, we have secured PTCs under safe harbor for our current 2016-20 business plan target additions of 1.8 GW. This includes PPAs of 1.1 GW, more than 55% of which were signed with non-utilities. Also, 0.4 GW of this capacity was already commissioned in 2016. We are currently taking continuous commercial actions to close PPAs for the remaining 0.7 GW; for which we have over 5 GW of possibilities in the pipeline. If we find conditions to promote even more of our pipeline than our initial target, we have also secured PTCs under safe harbor for an additional 1.3 GW as an option we can execute namely through a â€œbuild and transferâ€ approach without affecting our balance sheet. The fundamentals in favor of renewables remain in place. In most of the country, wind and solar are already the sources of energy with the lowest levelized costs - even unsubsidized - and those costs are expected to decline further in the years to come. Even though the Clean Power Plan is now likely to be delayed, plenty of additional demand for renewable energy will still exist; note that it provided less than 5% of the nationâ€™s electricity in 2015.   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  These increases in demand are the result of three clear drivers: increasing renewables quotas under the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) defined at the state level; utilities retiring coal power plants, which are either old or non-compliant with environmental regulations; and increased interest from the C&I (commercial and industrial) segment in negotiating long-term contracts directly with renewables suppliers, which in 2015 accounted for more than 50% of the PPA market. Moreover, deploying renewable infrastructure generates local jobs and benefits local communities and economies, generally in rural areas. If the likely tax reform includes a reduction in the current 35% federal income tax rate, the tax burden over the return on assets will surely be reduced. However, it is still too early to assess the full potential impact of this change and any eventual effects on the financing conditions from the indispensable tax equity. Q5 WHAT ABOUT THE SITUATION IN EUROPE? DO YOU SEE POSITIVE PROSPECTS THERE AS WELL? The case of Europe is a bit less prominent in the short term than that of the US, as the latter still has much lower penetration of renewables. In the long term, however, prospects are equally positive and share the same fundamentals. We believe that opportunities in Europe are set to escalate in the medium term based on several factors: the 2030 targets already unveiled, a 40% cut on CO2 emissions and over than 27% share of renewable energy consumption; the recovery of electricity demand together with a common vision in Europe for a competitive and sustainable energy matrix and a redesign of the market, and the wave of nuclear and coal power plant shut-downs already announced in several European countries. In the short term, opportunities are limited as electricity demand is stagnant or declining due to growing energy efficiency; a sluggish economy; and some degree of overcapacity of electricity systems that still persists. Thatâ€™s why we are currently exploring areas in Europe where our low-risk approach fits in. Projects with visible execution in our planned 2016-20 additions include 0.5 GW of capacity in Portugal, Italy and France, where suitable business opportunities are available with high visibility over prices in the long run. There is also Brazil, a growing wind energy market that  benefits from strong wind resource. We built 120 MW there in 2016, and have 127 MW under construction for 2017 and 143 MW in an auction secured for 2018. Despite some socio-economic turmoil in the country, we remain confident that Brazil will continue to provide profitable business opportunities for us. Q6 HOW DO YOU SEE EDPR IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND COST CONTROL? I believe that we have a distinctive approach as compared to our peers, namely in terms of our unique O&M strategy. We internalize our core activities through our modular maintenance and self-perform models for the wind farms in which the full-scope contract has already expired. By performing high value-added activities in house, we are able to reduce costs by extracting value from manufacturers while minimizing our dependency on them. Due to our experience and expertise in running wind farms, we are able to do this without jeopardizing the quality of our O&M activities or our technical availability. We carefully assess which maintenance model best fits each of our wind farms and, in the case of modular maintenance, we also decide on the level of insourcing activities. The results obtained confirm the success of this strategy as the 5% year-on-year decrease in the Cope Opex / Average MW is also supported by our O&M models. As our business plan describes, we expect to further decrease the proportion of full scope in our portfolio in the future. Q7 WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT COMPANY TO DELIVER ON YOUR PLAN? I can point to three essential qualities: our strong market positioning, solid balance sheet and excellent technical and human capital. Our teams have a visible track record of delivering results that reflect distinctive core competencies in areas that are key success factors for our industry. The systematic premium of our capacity load factors versus the averages computable in most of the markets where we operate is an indisputable indication of this. In 2016, our load factors surpassed the market average by 2 pp in Spain and France, 1 pp in Poland and 6 pp in Italy. Another clear sign of our teamsâ€™ outstanding collective performance is visible in our ability to win auctions profitably and close long-term contracts successfully. Just look to  11   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  our share in last yearâ€™s auction awarded in Canada and Italy, or our consistent ability to close long-term PPAs in the US, both with utilities and non-utilities. Naturally, this is also the outcome of our well-established presence in key markets with continuing business opportunities. We do not need to prioritize expansion into new countries, as there is enough scope in our current markets to deepen our presence while remaining diversified and maintaining our growth objectives. It is also important to be present in markets and technologies in which price is not all that matters, as in wind offshore in high-income economies such as the UK or France, or as in solar that complements the energy mix in many relevant markets, such as California or Southern Europe. Finally, we have the financial muscle to take on an investment plan close to â‚¬5 billion for the 2016-20 period even amid an external environment that is not always favorable to risk minimization that could allow the lowest cost of funding appropriate for such large long-term infrastructure investments. We rely mainly on our own net cash flow generation, supplemented by a logic asset rotation program. Our shareholders are confident in us, and are willing to accept a relatively modest dividend distribution that is justified by the accretive growth opportunities that we offer. Our sustainable business principles are well integrated into our day-to-day operations and in our strategic plan. Sustainability is at the core of EDPR, and a clear roadmap up to 2020 has been set based on explicit targets in 10 areas: health and safety, environmental protection, ethics, innovation, human capital development, social support, stakeholders management, waste management, CO2 avoidance and risk management.  12  Q8 IS THERE A FINAL MESSAGE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE? I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our confidence in achieving our business plan targets, namely a compounded annual EBITDA growth rate of 8% along with Retained Cash Flow of more than â‚¬900 million by 2020. Capacity additions are well on track. More than 65% of the 3.5 GW planned for 2016-20 has already been built or secured with high visibility over the top line, with prices awarded through auctions or long-term contracts. The outlook for 2017, is to reach low double-digit growth rates in EBITDA and Retained Cash Flow. That is based on the near term visibility of the operating drivers of the business, namely the earlier addition of new energy capacity and the superior performance of our Opex efficiency. I would like to thank all of our stakeholders - shareholders, employees, local communities, landowners, suppliers, public authorities, offtakers, among others - who help us achieve our business plan objectives on a daily basis and make it possible to construct and operate wind farms and solar plants at very high standard levels - powerful tools for tackling climate change. I'd like to especially thank our shareholders for their belief in us and our vision for the future, as well as our employees for their ability to stay focused and to transform challenges into opportunities.   1 The Company  EDP RenovÃ¡veis in Brief Vision, Mission, Values and Commitments World Presence Business Description Stakeholder Focus Sustainability Roadmap  17 18 20 21 24  2016 in Review Key Metrics Summary Share Performance  26 28  Organization Shareholders Governance Model Organization Structure  29 30 34     ENERGY AS THE NEWART  16  16   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  1 The Company  1.1.

STAKEHOLDER FOCUS (G4-24, G4-25, G4-26)1 EDP RenovÃ¡veis, in line with the policies created by the EDP Group, is an innovative company concerning the way it manages the relations with its stakeholders. One of the companyâ€™s main objectives is to serve and engage with not only its investors and shareholders, but with the remaining stakeholders as well: employees, suppliers, communities and the media, among others. All of these translates into important relationships that impact the companyâ€™s performance. Because of this vision, we aim to maintain and enhance an open and transparent dialogue with our stakeholders to build and strengthen trust, promote information and knowledge sharing, predict future challenges and identify opportunities for cooperation. We have four main guiding commitments: Comprehend, Communicate, Collaborate and Trust. These are part of a comprehensive plan that involves all business areas and uses cross-functional tools.  Comprehend  Communicate  Include, Identify, and Prioritize: We have dynamically and systematically identified the Stakeholders that influence by the Company, and we analyse and try to understand their expectations and interests in the decisions that directly impact on them.  Inform, Listen, and Respond: We are commited to promoting two-way dialogue with Stakeholders through information and consulting initiatives. We listen, inform and respond to Stakeholders in a consistent, clear, rigorous and transparent manner, with the aim of building strong, durable close relationships.  Collaborate  Trust  Integrate, Share, Cooperate, Report: We aim to collaborate with Stakeholders to build strategic partnerships that bring together and share knowledge, skills and tools, thereby promoting the creation of shared value in a differentiating manner.  Transparency, Integrity, Respect, Ethics: We believe that the promotion of a climate of trust with our Stakeholders is crucial to establishing stable, long-term relationships. Our relationship with stakeholders is based on values like transparency, integrity and mutual respect.  We want to communicate cohesively with the various groups of stakeholders, regardless of the department they fall under.

May 2016  Sep 2016  Feb 2017  2017  2015 Performance Survey Report  Kick-off Stakeholder Management Plan  2016 Performance Survey and internal data collection  On going Management Plan  This year we started a series of initiatives aiming to improve performance beyond mere adequacy and to truly engage our different stakeholder groups in a convergent manner and with common practices and messages. For this purpose, it was necessary to change from a vision and management centered on departments or business units to a corporate, cross-functional, convergent model that offers coherence and synergy, secure alignment and promote the efficient use of resources. Furthermore, a Stakeholder Steering Committee was created to establish the Stakeholders Management Plan, monitor progress and evaluate results. In addition, a Stakeholder Working Group, made up of members from different departments and units is in charge of enacting the committeeâ€™s plans, made the ideas operational and impactful. In addition to soft indicators such as satisfaction, relations, credibility, important issues for each stakeholder, delivery and transparency, the Stakeholders Management Plan also includes new indicators, such as the degree of influence on  Following the first major stakeholder survey conducted in Spain, working groups were set up to put in action plan into practice across the company.  business-related decision-making processes, as well as the relevance of issues for EDPRâ€™s business. Therefore, the Stakeholders Management Plans for 2016 and beyond aim not only to improve perception, but also make an impact on the business. Technological tools, such as CRM (Customer Relations Management), will be used in stakeholdersâ€™ management in order to re-shape the way information is handled.  HOW CAN WE IMPACT EDPRâ€™S BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL SCALE? Following this pilot project for stakeholders management in the Spanish market, in the future we will conduct similar practices across all EDPR markets around the world. The goal is developing a global vision of the companyâ€™s relationships with stakeholders across its different locations in a transversal way.  Main communication channels Media and all communication channels play a key role in managing the relations with the stakeholders. EDPR uses diverse channels to communicate with our stakeholders.

GOVERNANCE MODEL EDPRâ€™s corporate governance model is designed to ensure transparency and accountability through a clear separation of duties between management and supervision of the companyâ€™s activities. Corporate governance is about promoting corporate fairness, transparency and accountability. EDPRâ€™s corporate governance structure specifies the shareholders, board of directors, managers and other stakeholdersâ€™ rights and responsibilities and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions on corporate affairs. It also incorporates the organization's strategic response to risk management. The corporate governance structure adopted is the one in effect in Spain. It comprises a General Meeting of Shareholders and a Board of Directors that represents and manages the company. As required by the law and established in the companyâ€™s articles of association, the Board of Directors has set up four specialized committees. These are the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee and the Committee on Related-Party Transactions. This governance structure and composition was chosen to adapt the companyâ€™s corporate governance model also to the Portuguese legislation and it seeks, insofar it is compatible with the Spanish law, to correspond to the so-called â€œAngloSaxonâ€ model set forth in the Portuguese Commercial Companies Code, in which the management body is a Board of Directors, and the supervision and control duties are of the responsibility of a separate body, a Supervisory Board.  General Meeting of Shareholders  Board of Directors â€œBoDâ€  General Secretary  Executive Committee  Nominations and Remunerations Committee  Related-Party Transactions Committee  Audit and Control Committee  General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting is the body where the shareholders participate, it has the power to deliberate and adopt decisions, by majority, on matters reserved by the law or the articles of association.  30   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  Board of Directors  AntÃ³nio Mexia Chairman  Emilio GarcÃ­a-Conde General Secretary  JoÃ£o Manso Neto Vice-Chairman and CEO  Miguel Dias Amaro  JoÃ£o Paulo Costeira  Gabriel Alonso  CFO  COO Europe & Brazil  COO North America  Nuno Alves  Jorge Santos  JoÃ£o de Mello Franco  Chairman  Chairman  Manuel MenÃ©ndez  Allan J.Katz  AntÃ³nio Nogueira Leite  Gilles August  Francisco da Costa  AcÃ¡cio Piloto  JoÃ£o Lopes Raimundo  JosÃ© Ferreira Machado Chairman  Francisca Guedes de Oliveira  Executive Committee  Nominations and Remunerations Committee  Audit and Control Committee  Related-Party Transactions Committee  Independent Member  31   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  Board of Directors EDPRâ€™s BoD shall consist of no less than 5 and no more than 17 Directors, including a Chairperson. Currently it is composed by 17 board members, out of which 10 are independent. BoD members are elected for 3 years period and may be re-elected for equal periods. EDPRâ€™s BoD has the broadest power for the administration, management and governance of the company, with no limitations other than the responsibilities expressly and exclusively invested in the General Shareholders Meeting, in the companyâ€™s articles of association or in the applicable law. Its members must meet at least 4 times a year, preferably once a quarter. Nonetheless, the Chairperson, on his own initiative or that of 3 Directors, shall convene a meeting whenever he deems fit for the companyâ€™s interests.  Executive Committee EDPRâ€™s Executive Committee (EC) is composed by four members, including a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO coordinates the implementation of the BOD decisions and the Corporate and General Management functions, partially assigning those to the other executive officers, namely: the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Operating Officer for Europe and Brazil (COO EU & BR) and the Chief Operating Officer for North America (COO NA). The CFO proposes and ensures the implementation of the financial policy and management, including financial negotiation, management and control, cash management optimization and financial risk management policy proposal; he also coordinates and prepares the business plan and the budget, manages the financial statements reporting analyses the operational and financial performance and coordinates procurement function and relations with key suppliers while ensuring the implementation of the procurement strategy and policy. The COO EU & BR and the COO NA coordinate their platforms by developing, establishing and implementing the strategic plan for the renewable energy business in their respective platforms, in accordance with the guidelines set by the BOD; they are also responsible for planning, organizing and managing resources, controlling, measuring and improving the management of projects and subsidiary companies to achieve expected results to make EDPR a leader in the renewable energy sector in their respective platforms.  Nominations and Remunerations, Related-Party Transactions and Audit and Control Committees In addition to EC referred above, EDPR governance model contemplates permanent bodies with an informative, advisory and supervisory tasks independently from the BoD, such as:  Nominations and Remunerations Committee (Independent members)  Related-Party Transactions Committee  Audit and Control Committee (Independent members)  Functions  Assist and report to the BoD about appointments, re-elections, dismissals and remunerations of:  Perform the duties of ratifying transactions:  â€¢ Members of the BoD â€¢ Senior management personnel  â€¢ Its related parties, qualified shareholders, directors, key employees or his relatives  32 32  â€¢ Between EDPR and EDP  â€¢ Propose the appointment of the companyâ€™s auditors and the internal risk management and control systems â€¢ Supervise internal audits and compliance â€¢ Prepare an annual report on its supervisory activities   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  Remuneration Policy EDPR governance model is reinforced by an incentive structure with transparent remuneration through variable remuneration based on key performance indicators.

ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE The organization structure is designed to accomplish the strategic management of the company but also a transversal operation of all the business units, ensuring alignment with the defined strategy, optimizing support processes and creating synergies. EDPR is organized around three main elements: a corporate Holding and two platforms that group all the business units where the company has presence. Corporate Holding  Europe & Brazil  North America  Spain  Portugal  France  Belgium  Poland  Romania  United Kingdom  US West  US Central & Mexico  US East & Canada  Brazil  ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL PRINCIPLES The model is designed with several principles in mind to ensure optimal efficiency and value creation. â€¢  Accountability alignment  Critical KPIs and span of control are aligned at project, country, platform and holding level to ensure accountability tracking and to take advantage of complementarities derived from end-to-end process vision.  â€¢  Client-service  Corporate areas function as competence support centers and are internal service providers to all business units for all geographical non-specific needs. Business priorities and needs are defined by local businesses and best practices are defined and distributed by corporate units.  â€¢  Lean organization  Execution of activities at holding level are held only when significant value is derived, coherently with defined EDPR holding role.  â€¢  Collegial decisionmaking  Ensures proper counter-balance dynamics to ensure multiple-perspective challenge across functions.  â€¢  Clear and transparent  Platforms organizational models remain similar to allow for: - Easy coordination, vertically (holding-platforms) and horizontally (across platforms); - Scalability and replicability to ensure efficient integration of future growth.  EDPR HOLDING ROLE EDPR Holding seizes value creation, through the dissemination of best practices in the organization and the standardization of corporate processes to the platforms and the business units to improve efficiency. Its internal coordination model and interface with EDP group impacts both the companyâ€™s processes - activities performed, processes steps, inputs and outputs, and decision-making mechanisms -, and the companyâ€™s structure, with an alignment of functions and responsibilities with the processes configuration.  34 34   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  The EDPR Holding structure was designed to accomplish two fundamental roles: Strategic Management and Transversal Operation. Strategic Management covers to a) adopt a coordination model within the group, supporting the Executive Committee in the definition and control of the strategy policies and objectives; b) define specific strategic initiatives; c) review the accomplishment of the companyâ€™s business plan; d) define transversal policies, rules and procedures; e) control key performance indicators. Transversal Operation deals to i) ensure the alignment of all the platforms with the defined strategy; ii) capture synergies and optimize support processes; and iii) systematically and progressively concentrate supporting activities in shared service business units with the group.  INTEGRITY AND ETHICS Ethical behavior is absolutely essential for the functioning of the economy. EDPR recognizes its importance and complexity, and is committed to address ethics and its compliance. But is employeesâ€™ responsibility to comply with ethical obligations. GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR ETHICS Ethics are the cornerstone of EDPR strategy, to the extent that EDPR has a Code of Ethics and an Anti-Corruption regulation that go beyond just defining the company principles to be adopted, but also how employees and any other service provider working on behalf of EDPR should behave when dealing with the company stakeholders. The Code of Ethics has its own regulation that defines a process and channels to report any potential incident or doubt on the application of the code. The Ethics Ombudsman is behind this communication channel, and to analyse and present to the Ethics Committee any potential ethical problem. The code is communicated and distributed to all employees and interested parties, and complemented with tailored training sessions. HOW DO WE APPLY OUR CODE OF ETHICS? EDPRâ€™s Code of Ethics applies to all company employees, regardless of their position in the organization and working location, and they all must comply with. Our suppliers should be aligned with the spirit of our Code of Ethics, and this is reflected in our procurement policies. The Ethics Ombudsman plays an essential role in the ethics process. He guarantees impartiality and objectivity in registering and documenting all complaints of ethical nature submitted to him. He monitors their progress and ensures that the identity of the complainants remains confidential, while entering into contact with them whenever appropriate, until the case is closed. Identify an alleged violation of the code of ethics  Reports of alleged violations of the Code of Ethics must be submitted to the Ethics Ombudsman, indicating personal data and a detailed description of the situation.  Ombudsman performs a summary investigation  Ethics Ombudsman first confirms the events reported and submits a preliminary report on the initial confirmations to the Ethics Committee.  Ethics Committee decides if the complaint portrays a violation  Ethics Committee analyses every situation reported and decides as to whether it should be classified as a violation of the Code of Ethics.  When a violation is confirmed, the Committee opens an investigation  When conducting an investigation, the Company shall abide by the law and its own in-house rules. After the investigation is complete, the Committee decides whether any corrective or disciplinary action is required.  35  35   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  In 2016 there was one communication to the Ethics Ombudsmen through the Ethics Channel. However, it was not considered as an issue related to the Ethics Code and it will be suggested to be rejected during the next Committee Ethics. The issue has been submitted to the responsible area in order to be analyzed and take the corresponding measures. ETHICS PROGRAM EDPR is strongly committed with the dissemination and promotion of compliance with the Code of Ethics , which includes a Human Rights section, available to all employees through training, questionnaires, and open discussions of the findings. To this extent, from March to December 2016, EDP offered an online Ethics training (â€œÃ‰tica EDP") available to all employees of both Europe/Brazil and North America. This course achieved a major participation of around 900 EDPR employees. ANTI-CORRUPTION REGULATION In order to ensure compliance with the standards of Anti-Corruption Regulation in all geographies where EDPR operates, the Company has developed an Anti-Corruption Policy of application to all EDPR Group, which was approved by its Board of Directors on December, 2014. This Anti-Corruption Policy involves a series of new procedures regarding the relationships of EDPR employees with external parties, namely the approval of certain actions regarding hospitality to and from external parties, charitable donations, and sponsorships.  EMPLOYEE RELATIONS EDPR is committed to respect freedom of trade union association and recognises the right to collective bargaining. At EDPR, from 1,083 employees, 21% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements apply to all employees working under an employment relationship with some companies of EDPR group, regardless of the type of contract, the professional group into which they are classified, their occupation or job. However, matters relating to the corporate organization itself, the laws of each country or even usage and custom in each country result in certain groups being expressly excluded from the scope of collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements that are applied at EDPR are usually negotiated at state level or regional level, and EDPR may be just one of the players among other leading sectorial companies in the negotiation with employeesâ€™ representatives, and in some cases, governmental representatives. In Portugal and Brazil, EDP negotiates its own agreements with employees, and those apply to all employee working for companies of the group, including EDPR. Despite not taking an active part in the negotiations, EDPR wants to facilitate the broadcast of any update in those agreements. EDPR organized training sessions for its employees to inform about the results of those negotiations. During the last years, EDPR has performed different benchmark analysis of the benefits stated at the different collective bargaining agreements that apply to our employees, comparing them against the benefits offered by the company and, in general terms, the company offers a more competitive benefits package compared to what is stated in the collective bargaining agreement.  36 36   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  2 Strategy  Business Environment The Importance of Renewables The Evolution of Renewables Around the World Supportive Policy Instruments  Business Plan  41 45 46  52  Selective Growth Operational Excellence Self-Funding Model  53 55 57  Risk Management  59  37   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  38   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  39   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  16  40   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  2 Strategy  2.1.

On the other hand, renewables are increasingly competitive with conventional technologies while they achieve a myriad of socioeconomic benefits. Hence, renewable energies fuel economic growth, increase energy security, create new employment opportunities, enhance human welfare and contribute to achieve development goals, among other benefits. Necessary to stop climate change and comply with international agreements Human activities are releasing critical amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG), which trap heat and steadily drive up our planetâ€™s temperature, eventually compromising our climate. Climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is happening based on massive scientific record and climate change effects are easily observed and are evidenced by data as global temperatures increase of 0.9Â°C (compared to 1880â€™s levels), rising sea levels (around 17 cm in the last century) or, noticeable Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melting. There has been a â€œstep changeâ€ in momentum on climate change in the past decade, with large developing countries led by China aiming at reducing their emissions alongside accelerated action by the U.S. under President Barack Obama. The Paris Agreement, ratified in November 2016, aims at avoiding the worst effects of climate change and opens up a path towards a decarbonized economy. As anthropogenic GHG result primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, effective action in the energy sector is, consequentially, essential to tackle climate change issues. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), reaching a 30% renewables share by 2030, coupled with higher energy efficiency, would be enough to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2Â°C above preindustrial levels. It is becoming increasingly clear that the investments required to reduce emissions will be modest in comparison with the benefits from avoided climate change damages.  According to IRENA, the cost of doubling the renewable energy share by 2030 would be US$ 290 billion per year which is expected to be at least 4 and up to 15 times less than the external costs avoided.  Therefore, renewable energy is a cornerstone for achieving climate targets and onshore wind, because of its maturity and competitiveness, is expected to be at the forefront of the required transformation of our energy sector.  Renewables are the cheapest option in many parts of the world Nowadays, some renewableâ€™s technologies (wind and solar PV in particular)  are  competitive  with  conventional  technologies.  According to the levelised cost of energy (LCOE), onshore wind already generates the cheapest source of electricity in some regions while solar PV is also becoming increasingly competitive as stated by many experts and prestigious analysts, including Bloomberg Energy Finance, IRENA or Lazard. Despite the substantial cost reduction of onshore wind since the early 1980s, there is still significant further potential for the next decade as costs are  In Spain, according to the Spanish Wind Energy Association, 2016â€™s average wholesale electricity price would have been 15.3â‚¬/MWh higher (28%) if the 23 GW wind fleet had not been producing energy.  expected to keep falling due to improved turbine designs, the use of larger and more reliable turbines, increased hub heights and rotor diameters capable to unlock higher capacity factors at the same wind resource. According to IRENA, by 2025, the LCOE of onshore and offshore wind could see declines of  41  41   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  26% and 35% respectively, while solar PVâ€™s could fall by as much of 59%. Additionally, since renewables energies do not use fossil fuels, they are not exposed to their inherent price volatility, being their LCOE foreseeable and stable.  Levelized Revenue Requirements (â‚¬16/MWh):  260-370  190-280  100-120  95-125 60-80  55-110  70-90  90-160  55-85 45-60  CCGT  Coal  Nuclear  Hydro  Wind Onshore  Solar PV  Conventional  Biomass  Wind Offshore  Solar CSP  Ocean  Renewables  Source: EDPR Analysis  The increased competitiveness of wind was highlighted in the latest energy auctions held all over the world: in 2016, the price of wind energy, not only reached historical minimums (below 40US$/MWh), but was often lower than any other technology. On the other hand, increasing the supply of renewable energy tends to lower the average price per unit of electricity because they have very low marginal costs as they do not have to pay for fuel, therefore reducing wholesale prices and ultimately, the cost for consumers.  Fundamental pillar of sustainability and energy independence The limitless nature of wind resource contributes to its sustainability: the use of wind resource allows to slow down the pace of fossil fuel depletion and to maintain the balance between the existing natural resources and their consumption, besides having a reduced environmental impact as they do not pollute or generate waste, contributes to air quality and does not require water or fuels. Another advantage is that wind resource is also endogenous, improving countriesâ€™ energy supply security by decreasing the vulnerability of many countries due to interruption or alteration of the energy supply and enhances the energy independence, bringing significant cost savings by reducing gas and oil imports. This is very relevant for most of the countries, particularly in Europe, as the largest share of fossil fuel reserves is concentrated in a small number of countries (mainly in the Middle East).  A driver for growth and regional development Renewable energy generates wealth, support the creation of new jobs and strengthen industrial network. Compared with fossil fuel technologies, which are typically mechanized and capital intensive, the renewable energy industry is more labour-intensive as on average, more jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels. According to IRENA, the renewable sector employs, directly and indirectly, over 8 million of people around the word, of which, the wind sector represents more than 1 million jobs. Since most of the facilities are in rural areas, wind energy creates local wealth: the largest share of the jobs created are local and local taxes, in particular, land taxes, often represent a large share of the income of the municipalities in which wind farms are built. In developing countries, renewables are becoming increasingly important: an estimated 1.2 billion people still do not have access to electricity according to IEA, which severely jeopardizes their well-being and economic development, presenting a strong case for increased deployment of renewables, since off-grid renewable solutions offer the most cost-effective way to extend energy access to all.  Improved public health and environmental quality Building wind and solar facilities helps to improve public health mainly by displacing noxious emissions from coal-fired power plants. Air pollution is becoming a severe problem in many regions of the world, in particular in big cities, due to smog, which is highly toxic for the health, reduce visibility and contribute to acid rain, which can damage vegetation and crops. Air pollution has emerged as the deadliest form of pollution and the fourth leading risk factor for premature deaths worldwide, according to the World Bank. Those deaths cost the global economy about US$225 billion, the World Bank study finds, pointing toward the economic burden of air pollution.  42 42   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  PARIS AGREEMENT ALREADY RATIFIED BY COUNTRIES THAT REPRESENT AROUND 89% OF THE WORLDWIDE EMISSIONS The global low-carbon transition is already underway and gaining momentum, following the adoption of the first universal climate change agreement and its ratification in November 2016.

In the US, for example, corporate buyers (including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and many others), contracted for almost 2.5 GW of new renewable energy PPA capacity in 2016. The electricity sector will play a central role in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. It can almost totally eliminate CO2 emissions by producing electricity from renewable sources, and offers the prospect of partially replacing fossil fuels in transport and heating. Indeed, according to â€œClimate Action Trackerâ€, which provides independent scientific analysis, all 1.5Â°C pathways foresee a fully decarbonized power system by 2050, which implies a power system consisting entirely of renewables and other zero or low carbon sources.  What is the Paris Agreement? It is a climate accord reached by nearly 200 countries in December 2015. The Agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2Â°C seen as the threshold to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and endeavor to pursue a safer target of 1.5Â°C. Each country submitted national pledges to achieve the goals and the agreement includes a mechanism for periodical revisions of those targets. The agreement also include a long-term goal for a net zero emissions, which could effectively phase out fossil fuels. The accord also places a legal obligation to provide climate finance to developing countries.  43  43   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  YES TO WIND POWER In the wake of the of success of the Yes to Wind Power campaign launched in 2015 in Spain, it grew in 2016 by expanding into the markets of Italy, Romania, Poland and France. In order to demonstrate the benefits of renewable energy, especially wind power, the campaign aims above all to show that renewable energy is the most effective way to mitigate climate change in the short term and fulfill commitments made at COP21. In addition, it highlights the competitiveness of this type of energy. To inform society about these issues, this social media campaign centered on the Energy Hipster character who, in 2016, began answering questions and sharing the answers with the entire community on Facebook and Twitter. Through the Energy Hipster and the campaign webpage, journalists, opinion leaders and the general public across these four countries had access, in their language, to up-to-date scientific information in a format easy to read and understand.

THE EVOLUTION OF RENEWABLES AROUND THE WORLD Wind According to Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), 54.7 GW of wind capacity were grid-connected in 2016, bringing total global installed capacity to nearly 487 GW. Once again, China led wind power installations with 23.3 GW of new capacity, below 2015â€™s spectacular results (30 GW) though, raising its total wind installed capacity to 169 GW. With 0.6 GW offshore capacity installed in 2016, China overcame Denmark and achieved third place in global offshore rankings, after UK and Germany. The US was the second largest wind market with an additional 8.2 GW, bringing the US cumulative capacity to 82.2 GW, surpassing hydropower capacity to become the largest source of renewable capacity and the fourth largest overall. By state, Texas connected 2.6 GW in 2016, followed by Oklahoma (1.5 GW) and Iowa (0.7 GW). With these additions Texas remains the largest wind State, outstripping the 20 GW landmark, followed by Iowa (6.9 GW) and California (5.7 GW). US also commissioned its first offshore wind project, the 30 MW Block Island project off the coast of Rhode Island. In Europe, renewable energy sources made up nearly 90% of capacity additions, a sign of the continentâ€™s rapid shift away from fossil fuels. For the first time, wind overtook coal and became the second largest source of power generation capacity only behind natural gas, which is particularly impressive as ten years ago it was only the sixth technology. In 2016, wind facilities made up more than half of Europe's new power capacity and met 10.4% of total electricity demand. According to Wind Europe, 12.5 GW  Almost 90% of new power in Europe from renewable sources in 2016  of wind were installed during 2016 in EU, of which 1.6 GW were offshore, representing together 51% of all new capacity. These results make cumulative installed capacity in Europe amounting to 153.7 GW of wind, of which 12.6 GW are offshore, cementing the European leadership. Germany was again the largest market with 5.4 GW of new capacity (of which 0.8 GW were offshore) and France came second with a record year of 1.6 GW, followed by Turkey (1.4 GW) and Netherlands (0.9 GW, of which 0.7 GW offshore). In terms of cumulative capacity, Germany maintains its leadership with 50.0 GW, followed by Spain (23.1 GW), UK (14.5 GW), France (12.1 GW) and Italy (9.3 GW). In Latin America, 2016 was a remarkable year for Brazil that installed 2.0 GW and surpassed 10 GW of wind installed capacity. Chile added 0.5 GW reaching 1.4 GW of capacity while Mexico connected 0.5 GW closing the year with 3.5 GW. Other emerging economies that achieved very good results were India, setting a new national record of 3.6 GW and consolidating its position as fourth largest wind market, South Africa (0.4 GW) and Pakistan (0.3 GW).  Solar 2016 was an outstanding year for solar PV with 76.1 GW of capacity additions which compares with 51.2 GW in 2015. The largest market was China, which added 34.2 GW, an 125% increase versus 2015. US ranked second with estimated additions of 14 GW, up from 7.3 GW in the previous year and Japan and India were the following markets adding, respectively 8.6 and 4.5 GW. European countries installed around 6.9 GW of solar power in 2016, a 20% decrease compared to the 8.6 GW that was installed in the previous year, according to Solar Power Europe. The growth was mainly driven by the UK, Germany, Turkey and France.  â€œ2016 will be remembered as the year that the first solar PPAs were signed at levels that have made solar the lowest-cost power in many regions of the worldâ€, James Watson (Solar Power Europe CEO)  45  45   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  2.1.3. SUPPORTIVE POLICY INSTRUMENTS A wide range of remuneration schemes has traditionally supported Renewablesâ€™ projects. However, the most frequent schemes are: â€¢  FEED-IN TARIFF (FIT) SYSTEMS: most popular scheme due to its simplicity and visibility for investors, where generators receive either a fixed payment for each unit of electricity generated regardless of the market price, or a payment on top of market price (â€œFeed-in premiumâ€ and â€œContract-for-differenceâ€ schemes).  â€¢  QUOTA OBLIGATIONS: on top of the market price, generators receive certificates for their final energy ("Green Certificates" or "GC") which can be sold to the offtakers obliged to fulfil a quota obligation (a share of energy that must be sourced from renewable sources), therefore providing additional income to the generators.  â€¢  TENDERS AND AUCTIONS: are becoming increasingly popular, they do not represent a support category per se as they are used to allocate financial support to different renewables technologies and to determine the support level of other types of support schemes, such as feed-in systems, in a competitive bidding procedure.  â€¢  OTHER: includes investment grants, low interest loans and tax exemptions to support renewables.  The table below describes the overall current regulation in the geographies where EDPR operates.

The proposals represent a key piece of the ECâ€™s pledge to create an EU-wide Energy Union and includes five main areas: Renewable Energy Directive, Market Design review, Governance, Efficiency and Security of Supply. The package consists of eight legislative proposals, including the â€œEnergy Union Governance Regulationâ€ and a new â€œRenewable Energy Directiveâ€, together with four non-legislative documents and nine other reports and initiatives. All the legislative proposals still need the approval of the  2030 targets  European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which could materialize at the end of 2018. The  â€œRenewable  Energy  Directiveâ€  seeks  to  cement  40% GHG reduction versus 1990  27% share of renewable energy  commitments made in the Paris Agreement, where the EU  European target, binding at national level  pledged to cut GHG (greenhouse gases) by 40% on 1990 levels  30% energy savings  European target, non binding at national level  by 2030 and increase by 27% its share of renewables. Proposals also include plans to increase energy efficiency levels by 30% by 2030. The EC, as part of the new governance framework, will monitor the completion of the climate and energy 2030 targets. In view to fulfil the targets, Member States (MS) will be required to develop â€œ2030 National Energy and climate plansâ€ in which each MS will set the pathway to deliver their objectives. If those plans do not add up to the EUâ€™s binding target,  â€œWe are on the brink of a clean energy revolutionâ€ (Miguel Arias CaÃ±ete, EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy)  the EC will be able to trigger measures at EU level to fill the gap. The new Renewable Energy Directive proposal also advocates for 3 years of visibility for renewable energy support, as it requires MS to define at least a 3year schedule for the allocation of support, including timing, capacity and budget. It also requires MS to ensure that any modification of their support scheme does not negatively affect the economics of renewable energy projects.  The 2030 targets imply that almost half of electricity in Europe will be generated by renewables in 2030. The EC acknowledges this fact and seeks to integrate renewables into power markets, enhancing their flexibility while making them fit for an increasingly share of variable generation.  The most relevant recent regulatory developments in the European countries where EDPR is present are below described (for additional information, please refer to Note 01 of EDPR Consolidated Annual Accounts).  SPAIN On January 2016, the first auction of renewablesâ€™ capacity was held, designed to provide a similar remuneration scheme to the one that applies to current installations (ruled by RD 413/2014). Following this framework, tender participants were requested to bid discounts on the â€œinitial investmentâ€ parameter that determines the â€œinvestment premiumâ€ that would eventually be awarded. The auction was very competitive, around 5 times oversubscribed for onshore wind. EDP RenovÃ¡veis was awarded 93 MW of wind energy. The Spanish Government announced a new renewablesâ€™ capacity auction for the first months of 2017 requiring projects to be completed by December 2019.  PORTUGAL On October 2016, the Portaria 268-B/2016 on the clawback of non-refundable subsidies received from public development programs was published.  47  47   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  FRANCE On April 2016, the government enacted the â€œProgrammation Pluriannuelle des Investissementsâ€ which set renewablesâ€™ capacity targets by technology, including a provisional timetable of the renewable tenders to be launched until 2019. A new Contract-for-difference (CfD) scheme was released in December 2016 for wind farms having requested a PPA in 2016. The strike price will be equal to the value of the current feed-in-tariff (similar tenure, indexation and adjustment after year 10), plus a management fee to compensate balancing costs (2.8â‚¬/MWh). The market reference price will be the production weighted average Day Ahead Market price, using a representative production profile for wind industry. It was also disclosed the draft decree for the 2017 CfD for wind farms with less than six wind turbines, where the CfD tenure extended from 15 to 20 years, being the strike price of 72â‚¬/MWh plus the management fee.  ITALY Final approval of the new Decree envisaging tenders for 2016 in June. This decree follows the provisions of 2011 Italian RES (Renewable Energy Sources) Law and as such, although with some small adjustments, is very similar to the one approved in 2012 which set the framework for the first three onshore wind tenders. The new decree envisaged one sole 800 MW onshore wind tender. The Energy Agency of Italy, Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (GSE) released in December 2016 a list of projects that won offtake contracts in 2016 tender. EDP RenovÃ¡veis won PPAs for 6 wind farms totaling 127 MW with an awarded price of 66â‚¬/MWh and in case the realized market price is lower than the awarded price, the difference will be paid by GSE.  POLAND On June 2016 the so-called â€œWind Turbine Investment Actâ€ was approved, introducing, among other measures, new minimum distance restrictions for new wind farms and increased real estate burden. Also on June 2016, some amendments of the RES Act Chapter 4 were approved. Although the core of the new auction system remained unchanged, some modifications were introduced, namely technology baskets for future tenders, improving the treatment of biomass, biogas and cofiring technologies. On November 2016, the Polish government disclosed a draft ordinance detailing the amount and value of energy planned to be auctioned in 2017. The draft states that baseload renewables (dedicated biomass and biogas) will have a share of around 50% of the total 2017â€™s auction budget but new onshore wind could also compete for an amount up to 150 MW.  ROMANIA The Romanian government approved the draft ordinance setting a quota of 8.3% for 2017. On October 2016, the Ministry of Energy published for consultation a draft amendment to the current RES Law and released a new draft in November, incorporating some improvements over the previous version. Among other amendments, an extension of the GC scheme until 2031, a removal of the indexation of the GC parameters and the extension of the GC recovery for wind energy from 2018 to 2025. Regarding PV projects, the draft amendments propose an extension of the GC postponement until end of 2024, fixing the recovery from 2025 to 2030.  UNITED KINGDOM In November 2016, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) released details on the next CfD round. The second allocation round is expected to begin in April 2017 with projects to compete for GBP 290 million of annual support for the delivery years 2021/22 and 2022/23 (although offshore projects might be phased up to two years subsequent to 2022/23). It will only include less established technologies, as offshore wind. The administrative strike price for offshore wind is set at 105 GBP/MWh for projects deploying in 2021/2022 and 100 GBP/MWh for projects deploying in 2022/2023.  48 48   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  NORTH AMERICA TO CONTINUE LEADING THE WAY Historically, the typical framework of wind development in the US has been decentralized, with no national feed-in tariff, involving the combination of three key drivers of the top line: â€¢  PTCs: production tax credits are the dominant form of wind incentives in the US, and represent an extra source of revenue per unit of electricity ($23/MWh in 2016), over the first 10 years of the assetâ€™s life.  â€¢  ITCs: investment tax credits equal to 30% of the initial capex are the primary incentive for solar.  â€¢  PPAs: long-term, bilateral power purchase agreements by which a wind developer can sell its output at a fixed price, usually adjusted for a negotiated escalator.  In addition, many states have passed legislation, principally in the form of renewable portfolio standards (RPS), which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy supply from renewable sources, setting penalties to those that do not comply. Utilities can invest directly in renewable generation assets, purchase electricity from other renewable generators or purchase RECs. As a result, many utilities setup auction systems to seek long-term power purchase agreements with renewable energy generators. The relevant recent regulatory developments in North America are below described (for additional information on, please refer to Note 01 of EDPR Consolidated Annual Accounts).  UNITED STATES On December 2015, the US Congress approved the "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016" that included an extension of the PTC for wind and the possibility of a 30% ITC instead of PTC and the extension of the ITC for solar. The Congress introduced a phase out of the credits. Wind projects that start construction in 2020 or late will not have PTC or ITC and solar projects placed in service after 2023 will qualify to just 10% ITC. The graphic below depicts the phase-out calendar:  Start of construction... 2016  2017  2018  Start of construction... 2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2016  ...  2020  2021  ...end of construction  100% 30%  2022  2023  >2023  ...end of construction 30%  80% 24%  26% 60% 18%  22% 40% 12%  PTC (Wind): % of full PTC ($23/MWh in 2016)  10%  ITC (Solar): % of Capex  ITC (Wind): % of Capex  On May 2016, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance that wind farms have 4 years from their start of construction to be placed in service and qualify for the PTC. As a result, projects that start construction prior to yearend 2019 and are placed in service prior to year-end 2023 will be eligible for the PTC. The IRS ruling also includes a provision that allows developers to secure the PTC if 5% of a project's capital components by dollar value are safe harbored in a given year and construction is complete within 4 years. Thus, if a developer safe harbors 5% of project Capex in 2016 for a given project, the project will qualify for 100% PTC if construction is completed by year-end 2020. On August 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants. On February 2016, the Supreme Court stayed implementation of the CPP pending judicial review and as of year-end 2016, the review process is ongoing with the DC Circuit Court. A ruling is widely expected by mid-2017, however it is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court regardless of outcome. Regarding RPS, some states have upgraded their targets in 2015 and 2016: California and New York targeted 50% renewables by 2030, Oregon upgraded their RPS to 50% by 2040, Vermont enacted an RPS of 75% by 2032 and Michigan upgraded their RPS to 15% by 2021. In 2016, both New Jersey and Massachusetts proposed (but as of year-end 2016  49  49   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  had not yet adopted) to upgrade their RPS standards to 80% by 2050.

MEXICO Mexico is redesigning its energy sector beginning with the constitutional amendment in 2013 and ending with implementation by end of 2018. The reforms bring about the end of state-owned vertically-integrated monopolies and open the door to significant opportunities for private sector participation across the supply chains for oil and gas and for electricity. Mexicoâ€™s energy reforms advanced significantly in 2016 to implement changes that provide remuneration for all forms of generation including wind and solar. The key mechanisms of interest to renewable developers are the implementation of the wholesale electricity market, long-term supply auctions for supply, and financial transmission rights. Two long-term supply auctions have been conducted to date with a third planned for April 2017.  50 50   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  THE AGE OF AUCTIONS HAS ARRIVED In recent years, the renewable energy sector has undergone a profound transformation, as the sector has witnessed a rapid decline of wind and solar PV costs, a high penetration of renewable sources, a greater competition among players and technologies, a massive adoption of renewable targets and more stringent state-aid rules, among other changes. To adjust to these trends, support mechanisms have adapted so that they ensure greater deployment of renewables in a cost-effective manner. In this context, auctions, alone or in combination with other support schemes have often become the preferred option. Indeed, these schemes allow to control renewablesâ€™ volume deployment (in particular to avoid uncontrolled surge of new facilities) while decreasing the chances of governments over-subsidizing the sector because of a lack of information. Latin America is probably the region with the larger experience of auctions for renewable energy. Brazil alone has contracted more than 20 GW. Other countries, most notably Peru, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay have also held renewable auctions in the last years. In Europe, there has been an increasingly interest in auctions, reinforced by regulation. Indeed, the â€œEuropean Commission State Aid Guidelines for Environmental Protection and Energy 2014-2020â€ obliges all Member States to set up competitive bidding processes to grant support to all new facilities by January 2017, with only few exceptions. Renewable developers are embracing auctions as a way to secure predictable cash flows and therefore, mitigate price volatility and regulatory risk. 2016 was a year of record for low price auctions all around the world: for instance, in wind technology Morocco (below 30 US$/MWh) and Peru (below 40 US$/MWh) are good examples, or in solar PV, prices fell to historic lows in Chile. However, the most unexpected low figures probably came from offshore projects, which have witnessed astonishing low prices like the ones in the latest offshore tender in Denmark, although the price is not directly comparable to those awarded in the UK, as the former exclude grid connections costs and are located at shallower depths, but are nevertheless substantially lower. Another example was the 700 MW of offshore wind capacity awarded by the Dutch Government in December 2016, which resulted in a 25% reduction compared to the previous auction (only a few months earlier) of neighboring projects.

Business Plan EDPRâ€™s value creation strategic plan through 2020 remains in line with previous architecture, supported by three pillars with defined goals: Selective Growth, Operational Excellence and Self-funding Model. On May 2016, EDPR presented to the financial community its Business Plan for 2016-20 at the EDP Group Investor Day held in London. In the event were present several financial markets participants, including press, online participants, investors, analysts and rating agencies, demonstrating a great interest from the financial community in the groupâ€™s equity story and strategy. EDPR increased its 2014-17 Business Plan into a new Business Plan with stronger capacity additions and technological mix. Since its inception, EDPR has been performing a strategy focused on selective growth, by investing in quality projects with predictable future cash-flows, and seamless execution, supported by core competences that yield superior profitability, all embedded within a distinctive and renowned self-funding model designed to accelerate value creation. As a result of undertaking such strategy, at the same time flexible enough to accommodate to changing business and economic environments, EDPR remains today a global leading company in the renewable energy industry.

SELECTIVE GROWTH The selective growth strategic pillar is the key principle behind EDPRâ€™s investment selection process, it ensures that the projects that are finally built have the best fit with the Companyâ€™s low risk profile at superior profitability. This strategy is part of the 2016-20 Business Plan growth options, as projects have been selected according to two key guidelines: 1) Low risk profile â€“ New capacity benefits from long-term PPAs already secured or long-term contracts awarded under stable regulatory frameworks. This guarantees high visibility of the projectâ€™s future cash-flows, reducing risk and locking-in project profitability. 2) High operational performance â€“ The projects selected exhibit strong operating metrics, namely above portfolio average load factor which improves  Capacity Additions (MW; %) 10%  65%  10%  15%  700 MW/year 2016-20  North America  project competitiveness and drives higher profitability.  Europe  EDPR is well on track to deliver on its business plan target growth of +3.5 GW  Solar PV  cumulative from 2016 to 2020 (700 MW/year) â€“ with 65% of the cumulative capacity additions target already secured and 820 MW installed in 2016. EDPRâ€™s  Brazil  Total of 3.5 GW capacity additions  extensive pipeline has been an important contributing factor to the successful execution of this strategy as the availability of multiple projects coupled with strong development expertise guarantees that only the best, fully optimized projects are finally selected for investment.  65% GROWTH FROM NORTH AMERICA, DRIVEN BY PPAs ALREADY SECURED The United States is EDPR main growth driver for the 2016-20 Business Plan timeframe. The visibility over Production Tax Credit (PTC) tax scheme, the strong demand from both utilities and commercial and industrial companies for longterm PPAs from wind energy projects, combined with EDPRâ€™s diversified portfolio of projects in this market support this solid growth opportunity. The December 2015 extension of the PTC, that includes a gradual phase out of the PTC value for projects that start construction before 2020, provides long-term visibility to US growth beyond 2016-20 for new wind energy projects, reinforces the strong fundamentals of the US wind market and supports EDPRâ€™s choice to shift growth to the US. The Business Plan for 2016-20 targets 1.8 GW of wind onshore additions in the US, of which 1.1 GW were already secured as of December 2016 and are entitled to receive 100% PTC value. More than 55% of these projects were signed with non-utilities companies, another key driver of the US market. Previously the demand for PPAs came only from traditional utilities, however, recently the direct procurement from corporations has increased substantially, adding new demand for EDPRâ€™s US wind and solar projects. In addition, it is worth mentioning that EDPR secured turbine components in 2016 in order to have the option to further increase its capacity and install up to 3.1 GW of wind projects until 2020, benefitting from 100% of the PTC value. In 2014 EDPR entered the Mexican market by signing a bilateral long-term supply agreement, for the energy produced by a 200 MW wind farm which was completed in 2016, representing a sizeable entry in an attractive market. Mexico is a country with great potential for wind energy and this achievement can provide a solid platform for further growth. In 2016 EDPR was also awarded a 20-year PPA in Ontario, Canada, which is already under development and expected to be commissioned by 2019.  53  53   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  US and wind onshore at the core of EDPR growth strategy 157 MW  US Capacity additions (GW) 60%  (CoD 2016/17)  Project Name MW  State  Hidalgo  250  Texas  100  Ohio  2016  Jericho  78 79  New York 2017  Meadow Lake V  100  Indiana  100 MW  (CoD 2016)  New York 2016  Arkwright  200 MW  2016  Timber Road III  1.8 GW 2016-20  98 MW  (CoD 2017)  CoD  2017  Quilt Block  98 99  Secured  200  Iowa  Meadow Lake VI  75  Indiana  99 MW  (CoD 2017)  2018  Under negotiation/identified  (CoD 2017/18)  Oklahoma 2017  Turtle Creek  175 MW  Wisconsin 2017  Red Bed  (CoD 2018)  2018  Option to grow 3.1 GW with safe harbor  1.1 GW already secured >55% secured with non-utilities  250 MW  (CoD 2016)  15% GROWTH FROM EUROPE, FOCUSING ON LOW RISK FRAMEWORKS Certain European markets continue to provide good growth opportunities supported by regulatory frameworks that provide low risk environment. For the 2016-20 Business Plan, EDPR growth in Europe represents c.15% of the planned capacity additions, a growth supported by identified short-term opportunities and medium-term pipeline options. In terms of additions by country, EDPR has very focused targets. Firstly, in Portugal, 216 MW will be added with a 20-year feed-in tariff. Then Italy with c.200 MW target additions, of which 44 MW installed in 2016 and 127 MW awarded as a 20-year contracts in December 2016 to be installed in 2018. In France, existing feed-in tariff regime provides a stable growth opportunity, driving EDPR targeted additions to c.100 MW through pipeline development, of which 24 MW were already installed by December 2016. Finally, in Spain, EDPR was awarded in January 2016, rights for the pre-registry of 93 MW of wind energy capacity in the renewable energy auction.  10% FROM BRAZIL, IN PROJECTS WITH LONG-TERM PPAs In Brazil, EDPR already installed 120 MW related to Baixa do FeijÃ£o project, which was completed on the first quarter of 2016. On the top of that, EDPR is developing 267 MW, awarded in 2013-15, to be installed in 2017-18. These are projects with load factors above 45% and with PPAs linked to inflation, representing a mid/high double digit project IRR. Additionally, EDPR is to remain actively prospecting opportunities in Brazil, namely auction opportunities, given the strong fundamentals of the country, with high growth of electricity demand, robust renewable resources and availability of long-term energy supply agreements through an auction system.  TECHNOLOGICAL MIX 10% GROWTH IN SOLAR, GIVEN ITS INCREASING COMPETITIVENESS In order to take advantage of every profitable renewable technology and considering its increasing competitiveness, EDPR included in its 2016-20 Business Plan a 10% of growth in PV solar technology. The US is the core market for this growth, where  10% +3.5 GW 2016-20  the technology is boosted by the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) scheme, while in Europe, Brazil and Mexico developing options are based on projectsâ€™ fundamentals.

ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  2.2.2. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE One of the strategic pillars that has always been a keystone of the company, setting it apart in the industry, is the drive to maximize the operational performance of its wind and solar plants. In this area, EDPRâ€™s teams, namely in operations and maintenance (O&M), have established a strong track record that supports challenging targets set in the 2016-20 Business Plan. For this period, EDPR has set targets for three key metrics: Load Factor and Technical Availability, along with optimization of Core Opex1 per MW. These metrics provide an overall view of the progress in EDPR wind assessment, O&M and cost control efforts. They also serve as good indicators for the overall operational efficiency of the company. BP 2016-20  Operational Excellence Targets  Technical Availability  Load Factor  >97.5%  33%  -1%  in 2020  CAGR 2015-20  Competitive projects leading to a superior load factor  Unique O&M strategy to keep lowering Core Opex/MW  Technical expertise to maximize production  Core Opex Per MW  MAINTAINING HIGH LEVELS OF AVAILABILITY >97.5% Availability is the ratio between the energy actually generated and the energy that would have been generated without any downtime due to internal reasons, namely due to preventive maintenance or repairs. Therefore it is a clear indicator of performance of the companyâ€™s O&M practices as it focuses on reducing to a minimum any malfunctions and performing maintenance activities in the shortest possible timeframe. The company always maintained high levels of availability and has registered availability of above 97.5% in 2016, in line with its 2016-20 Business Plan target. EDPR will continue to improve availability through new predictive maintenance optimization measures supported by the 24/7 control and dispatch centre, in reducing damages most common during extreme weather and improving the scheduling of planned stops. Also a new spare parts warehousing strategy will be key in reducing downtime during unexpected repairs.  LEVERAGING QUALITY GROWTH ON DISTINCTIVE WIND ASSESSMENT TOWARD 33% LOAD FACTOR Load factor (or net capacity factor) is a measure of the quality of the renewable resource that reflects the percentage of maximum theoretical energy output with an equipment working at full capacity, in a given period. Ensuring the assets generate the maximum amount of energy possible is a key success factor. With regards to the operating portfolio, optimizing load factor is linked to improving availability as above described and, if possible, introducing productivity enhancement retrofits that boost production by setting older equipment models with the most up-to-date technological improvements available to increase efficiency in the utilization of renewable resources available. With regards to wind farms and solar plants under development, maximizing load factor is mostly the expert work of energy assessment and engineering teams, which implies designing an optimal layout of the plant by fitting the positioning and choice among different equipment models with the characteristics of the site, specially the terrain, from the collected resource measurements and their estimated energy outputs. The company has consistently maintained levels of load factor in the range of 29-30%, having registered 30% in 2016, which is slightly below the P50 (mean probability) assessment for the current fleet, given the lower wind resource in the period when compared with an average year. For 2020 EDPR has a target to reach 33% load factor, mainly on the back of the increase competitiveness of new capacity additions. 1  Supplies and Services + Personnel Costs  55  55   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  INCREASING EFFICIENCY, REDUCING CORE OPEX/MW -1% In addition to all company initiatives to boost production, EDPR also focuses on strict cost control efforts to improve efficiency and gain additional profitability. Leveraging on the experience accumulated over time, EDPR set a target in the 2016-20 Business Plan to reduce Core Opex/MW by -1% CAGR 2015-20. Core Opex refers the costs of Supplies & Service along with Personnel Costs, which are the ones controllable by the company. The target of reducing the manageable company costs structure, also benefits from the economies of scale of a growing company. With regards to O&M, representing c. 30% of total Opex, EDPR has already delivered results from the implementation of its M3 (Modular Maintenance Model) system and self-perform program to some of the wind farms that are no longer subject to initial warranty contracts.  M3 PROGRAM AND SELF-PERFORMANCE As EDPRâ€™s fleet becomes more mature the initial O&M contracts signed with the turbine suppliers expire. When that happens the company needs to decide between renewing the maintenance service with the OEM2 or insourcing activities to operate the wind farm on its own, whilst maintaining high levels of availability. Based on EDPRâ€™s expertise, under the M3 program O&M teams will decide on the optimal balance between external contractors and in-house maintenance. Usually, EDPR keeps control of high value-added activities such as maintenance planning, logistics and remote operations while outsourcing, under direct supervision, labor-intensive tasks. This new program immediately showed savings in operational expenses and increased control over quality. During 2016 selfperform maintenance was implemented in additional facilities whose maintenance contracts were up for renewal. The self-perform program is a step further in EDPR integration of maintenance tasks and activities, which is being implemented in the US, and consequently minimizing third-parties dependency. EDPR targets to increase the share of its fleet under the M3 and Self-Perform program up to c.50% by 2020, from c.30% levels in 2015.  Modular Maintenance Model (M3)  Lower Costs  Portfolio by O&M contract type  Segregate & insource main maintenance activities ISP1  OEM2 100%  90%-70%  EDPR  Full scope  Self-perform (SP)  M3 & Self perform  Insource more activities: preventative, logistics & small correctives EDPR 1  Full Scope  M3 & SP  2015  2020E  OEM2  ISP - Independent Service Provider;  2  OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer  INCREASING PRODUCTION For the period 2016-20, and in line with its previous targets, EDPR aims to increase its total production by 10% CAGR 2015-20. This growth is to be supported by its distinctive competences and accretive projects. EDPR is also creating value by improving its assets by implementing new technologies on the turbines to boost the power output without requiring major component changes. Performance Analysis teams are collaborating with the manufacturers to determine the best practices to apply this new technology. For instance, installing new versions of the softwares on the older machines with the support of the manufacturer, improves the operation of the turbine and increases its efficiency. Another measure is the implementation of Vortex generators where some components are installed on the blades, modifying and improving the bladesâ€™ aerodynamics, achieving an increase in efficiency. By monitoring real-time conditions, the rotational speed of the generator can be increased while staying within the existing loads, thus increasing the power output and the wind farm revenues, without major investments. This technology has successfully being applied on many turbines and will keep being developed in the coming years. 2  Original Equipment Manufacturer  56 56   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  2.2.3. SELF-FUNDING MODEL EDPR self-funding model has been a cornerstone of EDPRâ€™s strategy and its success has been crucial for funding growth. The self-funding model relies on a combination of the Retained Cash Flow from operating assets and EDPRâ€™s successfully Asset Rotation strategy, along with the US Tax Equity structures to finance the profitable growth of the business. This model, that was already included in the previous business plan, substitutes the initial financing strategy that depended on corporate debt from EDP, the major shareholder of EDPR. Quality portfolio generating robust Retained Cash Flow  Retained Cash Flow (â‚¬ billion)  Rigorous investment plan set to deliver solid returns  2016-20  Cumulative for 2016-20  Capex and Financial Investments  â‚¬4.8 bn  Onshore + Solar PV Offshore  > 90% < 10%  New Asset Rotation (based on projects with PPAs)  up to â‚¬0.6 bn â‚¬120 m/year  Cumulative Asset Rotation  6.8  â‚¬1.1 bn  3.9  (including already signed in 2016)  EBITDA  Interest & TEI costs  Minorities Distributions  Taxes & Other  RCF  RETAINED CASH FLOW The primary source of funds for the company is the EBITDA generated from the existing assets, which after paying debt services costs, deduct capital distributions to equity partners and taxes is called Retained Cash Flow, meaning the amount available to pay dividends to EDPR shareholders and/or to fund new investments. A strong Retained Cash Flow generation of c.â‚¬3.9 billion is expected for the period 2016-20, which is cash available after taxes, interests and tax equity costs and distribution to minorities. EDPR indicated in May 2016, a dividend pay-out ratio policy in the range of 25-35% of its annual net profit, thus allowing most of the Retained Cash Flow to fund growth. The dividends paid in 2016 amounted to c.â‚¬44 million corresponding to the low end of the range relative.  ASSET ROTATION Proceeds from asset rotation transactions are also important sources of funds for the self-funding model of EDPR in financing its profitable growth. This enables the company to crystallize the value yet to be realized from the future cash-flows of its existing projects over their long remaining lifetime and reinvest the corresponding proceeds in the development of new value accretive projects, with superior returns. These transactions involve the company selling minority stakes (typically 49% stake) at project level while maintaining full management control over them. The scope of these transactions tend to be mature projects, generally already operating and thus significantly derisked, with high visibility of future cash-flows, that can be attractive to low risk institutional investors from whom EDPR can source a competitive cost of finance.  57  57   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  For the period 2016-20 EDPR has the target of completing â‚¬1.1 billion of Asset Rotation transaction, which as of December 2016 was already executed â‚¬550 million. The execution of those â‚¬550 million took place in April 2016, with EDPR entering into an agreement with Vortex, a fund led by EFG Hermes which includes investments from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, to sell a 49% equity shareholding and outstanding shareholders loans in a portfolio of fully-owned wind onshore assets in Spain, Portugal, Belgium and France. The portfolio totalled 664 MW with 4-year average life, of which more than half located in Spain. This transaction was highly valued by the market due to the above market multiple at which EDPR was able to close the deal, â‚¬1.73 million/MW, a clear indicator of the quality of the companyâ€™s installed asset base that has attracted the interest of many institutional investors. For the completion of the Asset Rotation target, EDPR will continue to seek accretive projects with superior returns, thus crystallizing value and accelerating profitable growth.  US TAX EQUITY EDPR always aims to find external financing to its projects, namely through tax equity structures, typical of the US. The use of tax equity in the US enables an efficient utilization of the tax benefits provided by the project, otherwise unusable, therefore improving projectsâ€™ economics. In a simplistic view, tax equity investors contribute a sizable part of the initial project investment, receiving in return almost all of the PTCs granted to the project for first 10 years of operation along with the benefits from the accelerated depreciation. In 2016 EDPR signed two tax equity transactions, a total funding of $457 million comprising 429 MW, related to all projects that started operations in 2016.

Risk Management In line with EDPRâ€™s controlled risk profile, Risk Management process defines the mechanisms for evaluation and management of risks and opportunities impacting the business, increasing the likelihood of the company in achieving its financial targets, while minimizing fluctuations of results.  RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS EDPRâ€™s Enterprise Risk Management Process is an integrated and transversal management model that ensures the minimization of the effects of risk on EDPR's capital and earnings, as well as the implementation of best practices of Corporate Governance and transparency. The process aligns EDPRâ€™s risk exposure with the companyâ€™s desired risk profile. Risk management policies are aimed to mitigate risks, without ignoring potential opportunities, thus, optimizing return versus risk exposure. The process is closely followed and supervised by the Audit and Control Committee, an independent supervisory body composed of non-executive members. Risk management is endorsed by the Executive Committee, supported by the Risk Committee and implemented in dayto-day decisions by all managers of the company. EDPR created three distinct meetings of the Risk Committee in order to help decision-making, separating discussions on execution of mitigation strategies, from those on the definition of new policies: â€¢  RESTRICTED RISK COMMITTEE: Held every month, it is mainly focused on development risk and market risk from electricity price (market, basis, profile, GCs and RECs). It is the forum to discuss the evolution of projects under development and construction and the execution of mitigation strategies to reduce merchant exposure. It also monitors the limits of defined risk policies, with regards to counterparty risk, operational risk and country risk.  â€¢  FINANCIAL RISK COMMITTEE: Held every quarter, it is held to review main financial risks and discuss the execution of mitigation strategies. Exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk from financial counterparties are most relevant risk reviewed in this committee.  â€¢  RISK COMMITTEE: Held every quarter, it is the forum where new strategic analyses are discussed and new policies are proposed for approval to the Executive Committee. Additionally, EDPRâ€™s overall risk position is reviewed, together with EBITDA@Risk and Net Income@Risk.  RISK MAP AT EDPR Risk Management at EDPR is focused on covering all risks of the company. In order to have a holistic view, they are classified in five Risk Categories.  59  59   ENERGY ENERGY THE NEWART AS THE NEWART  Market Risks  Risk Categories  It refers to the risk to EDPR resulting from movements in market prices. Due to the relationship between wind production and electricity price production risk is considered within market risk.

Risk Groups  Electricity Price Risk  Inflation Risk  Interest Rate Risk  Liquidity Risk  Exchange Rate Risk  Commodity Price Risk  Electricity Production Risk  Risk that counterparty to a transaction could default before final settlement of the transactionâ€™s cash flows. A direct economic loss would occur if transactions with the counterparty had positive economic value at the time of default. Even in the case of not defaulting, it may not comply with its contract obligations (timing, quality, etc.), implying additional higher costs due to its replacement or  Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty Operational Risk  to delays in fulfilling the contract.  Development Risk  Legal Claims Risk (Compliance)  Execution Risk  Personnel Risk  Defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events (such as an increase in equipment default rates, increasing O&M, or natural disasters).  Operation Risk  (damage to Physical Assets and Equip. Performance)  Potential loss in the company's earnings due to adverse changes in business margins. Such losses can result, above all, from a serious increase in equipment prices or changes in the regulatory environment. Changes in electricity prices and wind production are considered market risks.  It refers to risks coming from macroeconomic, political, social or environmental situation in countries where EDPR is present, as well as those coming from a change in competitive landscape, from technology disruptions, from changes in energy markets or from governance decisions (investment decisions criteria, Corporate Governance and Reputational issues).

Counterparty Risk: Counterparty Risk Policy. Operational Risk: Operational Risk Policy. Strategic Risk: Country Risk Policy.  Additionally, in 2016 EDPR reassessed Operational Risk for the company, executing a bottom-up analysis across all departments, as stated in EDPRâ€™s Operational Risk Policy. The new assessment replaces the one executed in 2014 and it will be used when evaluating Net Income@risk, the structural risk measure that considers all risk factors and is recurrently monitored by the Risk Committee.  61   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  EDPR RISK MATRIX BY RISK CATEGORY EDPR Risk Matrix is a qualitative assessment of likelihood and impact of the different risk categories within the company.

The latter approach is called â€œEnterprise Risk Managementâ€ and is the approach used at EDPR. Enterprise risk management (ERM) is the process of planning, organizing, leading and controlling the activities of an organization in order to minimize the effects of risk on an organization's capital and earnings. Enterprise risk management expands the process to include not just risks associated with accidental losses, but also financial, strategic and other risks. Contents of an ERM Framework are defined similarly by different sources (Basel Committee, International Organization for Standardization and academic literature). In the case of EDPR, it was decided to follow Basel guidelines for ERM, adapted to the specificities of the renewable electricity generation business.

In US, EDPR started the works of the 100 MW Meadow Lake V project in Indiana. In Brazil EDPR has 127 MW under construction related to the JAU&Aventura projects after successfully bidding in the A5 auction for 20 year PPAs. Finally in Europe, 21 MW were under construction, of which 18 MW in France and 3 MW in Portugal. As a result of continuous growth effort, EDPR also has a young portfolio with an average operating age of 7 years, with an estimate of over 18 years of useful life remaining to be captured. In Europe, EDPRâ€™s portfolio had an average age of 7 years, in North America 6 years, and in Brazil 3 years.  68 68   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  3.1.2. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Revenues increased 7% YoY to 1.7 billion euros and EBITDA summed 1.2 billion euros In 2016, EDPR revenues totalled 1,651 million euros, an increase of 104 million euros when compared with 2015 mainly from capacity additions with an above portfolio average wind resource and with YoY comparison negatively impacted by an update, in 2015, of TEIâ€™s post-flip residual interest accretion. Despite the lower than long-term average wind resource, EDPRâ€™s output in the period increased 14%. The average selling price decreased by 5% mainly as a result of capacity additions mix (product vs price). Reported EBITDA increased 3% year on year to 1,171 million euros, with 29 million euros negative impact lower than average wind resource, leading to an EBITDA margin of 71%. If adjusted by non-recurring items, 2016 EBITDA increased 12% and EBITDA per MW in operation increased 1% to 128 thousand euros. Net Operating Costs totalled 480 million euros, with higher capacity in operation. Core opex (defined as Supplies and Services along with Personnel Costs) per average MW in operation decreased 5% YoY as a consequence of EDPRâ€™s strict control over costs and O&M programs in place.

Retained cash flow incresed 13% yoy to 698 million euros, capturing assetsâ€™ cash generation capabilities Despite the challenging year EDPR was able to deliver a robust cash-flow generation. Following EBITDA cash-generation, income tax of the period, interests, banking and derivatives expenses and minority dividends/interest payments, 2016 Retained Cash-Flow increased 13% to â‚¬698m. Capital expenditures (Capex) totalled 1,029 million euros reflecting the capacity added in the period, the capacity under construction and enhancements in capacity already in operation. Pursuing its asset ro ation strategy, in 2016, EDPR received proceeds of 1,189 million euros from the sale of non-controlling interests. On the back of its Asset Rotation strategy was completed the settlement of Axium transaction, signed in November 2015, EFG Hermes deal, signed in April 2016, and was completed the closing of European transactions with CTG, signed in December 2015. In the period, Net Debt totaled 2,755 million euros, lower YoY by 952 million euros. 6  69   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  INCOME STATEMENT Solid top line performance EDPR revenues increased 7% year on year to 1,651 million euros, despite the lower than long-term average wind resource and propelled by capacity additions with an above portfolio average wind resource and with YoY comparison negatively impacted by 2015 update of TEIÂ´s post-flip residual interest accretion.

Operating income (EBIT) decreased 2% YoY to 564 million euros, on the back of 8% increase in depreciation and amortization costs (including provisions, impairments and net of government grants), due to capacity additions. In 2016 EDPRâ€™s provisions totalled 5 million euros related to Portuguese subsidiesâ€™ clawback from public development programs. At the financing level, Net Financial Expenses increased 23%. Net interest costs decreased 6%, benefitting from the lower cost of debt in the period after debt renegotiations with EDP and others. Institutional Partnership costs were 11 million euros higher year on year, reflecting mainly new tax equity deals, while capitalized expenses remained flat. Forex differences and derivatives had a positive impact of 10 million euros in the period. Other financial expenses increased by 77 million euros, including one-offs mainly from debt repayment/restructuring and 14 million euros from discontinue hedge accounting related to Spanish operations, while year on year comparison is also impacted by ENEOP consolidation in September 2015. Pre-Tax Profit increased to 214 million euros, with income taxes totaling 38 million euros. Non-controlling interests increased to 120 million euros mainly due to EDPR settlement of asset rotation and CTG deals.

The increased equity attributable to the shareholders of EDPR by 154 million euros is due to mainly the 56 million euros of Net Profit and 160 million euros of Asset Rotation transactions, reduced by the 44 million euros in dividend payments. Total liabilities increased 3% by +259 million euros, mainly in accounts payable (+488 million euros) and institutional partnerships (+355 million euros), offset by a reduction in financial debt (-814 million euros). With total liabilities of 9.2 billion euros, the debt-to-equity ratio of EDPR stood at 121% by the end of 2016, which is a decrease from the 130% in 2015. Liabilities were mainly composed of financial debt (37%), liabilities related to institutional partnerships in the US (17%) and accounts payable (30%). Liabilities to tax equity partnerships in the US stood at 1,520 million euros, and including +628 million dollars of new tax equity proceeds received in the 2016. Deferred revenues related to institutional partnerships primarily represent the non-economic liability associated to the tax credits already realized by the institutional investor, arising from accelerated tax depreciation, and yet to be recognized as income by EDPR throughout the remaining useful lifetime of the respective assets. Deferred tax liabilities reflect the liabilities arising from temporary differences between the accounting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Accounts payables include trade suppliers, PP&E suppliers, deferred income related to investment grants received and derivative financial instruments. As total assets totalled 16.7 billion euros in 2016, the equity ratio of EDPR reached 45%, versus 43% in 2015. Assets were 80% composed of net PP&E - property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cumulative net invested capital in renewable energy generation assets. Total net PP&E of 13.4 billion euros changed to reflect 1,156 million euros of new additions during the year and 256 million euros from forex translation (mainly as the result of a US Dollar appreciation), reduced by 620 million euros for depreciation charges, impairment losses and write-offs. Net intangible assets of 1.6 billion euros mainly include 1.4 billion euros from goodwill registered in the books, for the most part related to acquisitions in the US and Spain, while accounts receivable are mainly related to loans to related parties, trade receivables, guarantees and tax receivables.

That is why we offer job-specific ongoing training opportunities to contribute towards enhancing knowledge and skills, as well as specific development programs aligned with the company's strategy. In this regard, in order to support the companyâ€™s growth, aligning current and future organizational demands with employeesâ€™ capabilities, as well as to enhance their professional development, EDPR has designed development programs for middle management, with the goal of providing them with the proper tools to take on new responsibilities.  During 2016, EDPR carried out the following Programs: LEAD NOW PROGRAM: an advanced program aimed at EDPR middle management to support them in their new roles. During the program, participants have the opportunity to self-assess their management style, go further into the skills needed to develop an efficient management approach and learn their new role in what regards the HR processes within their teams. EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: an advanced development program carried out in collaboration with a leading Business School designed to enhance the management and leadership skills of top-performing employees from across the business. Participants learn to take management decisions in a fast-paced and competitive environment, among other aspects. During the program, participants learn in-depth knowledge about our core business areas, working in teams on a practical EDPR Business Case to analyze new strategic opportunities for the company. This translates into the creation of several proposals capable of being implemented once the program is concluded.

The coaches are given the opportunity to detect their strong points and identify areas for improvement as a way to fine-tune their skills, always with the support of a guide who is always present at these sessions.  In addition to these specific development programs, each year, a customized Training Plan is created for all our employees based on the results of a skills assessment between manager and the subordinate to define the specific training needs of each employee. These steps allow us to align the organizationâ€™s current and futures needs with our employees' skill sets and expertise. In 2016, we delivered a total of 44,350 training hours, equivalent to 41 hours of training per employee. 100% of employees received training in 2016.  79  79   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  RENEWABLE ENERGY SCHOOL To achieve our training and new employeesâ€™ integration strategy, the Renewable Energy School plays a fundamental role. Established in 2011 within the framework of the Corporate EDP University, the Energy School aims to promote the development of individuals, facilitate learning and share knowledge generated within the Group as well as to acquire the skills needed to ensure the sustainability of EDPR's businesses across all the markets where the company is present. The objective of the School goes beyond mere training since it emerged also as a platform for sharing knowledge, expertise and best practices across the company. During 2016, 39 training sessions were delivered in Europe, the United States and Brazil, representing a total of 8,398 training hours and 1,027 attendances. A total of 735 employees took part in the School's courses, equivalent to 68% of the total headcount. The School engaged 116 experts within the organization to deliver the training sessions, 40% of whom were directors and heads of departments, which helped the transfer of knowledge to employees.  TRANSPARENCY ATTRACTING TALENT At EDPR, we strive to attract and retain professionals who seek to excel in their work in order to position the company as the "the first choice for employees" in the labor market. In this sense, EDPR launches initiatives on an ongoing basis to strengthen its image as a leading employer by participating at numerous job fairs and visiting prestigious universities and business schools. EDPR invests in the development of young people to help them becoming excellent professionals within the EDPR Group. To this end, EDPR offers an internship program in order to provide young professionals with work experience and to identify future employees who can contribute to the future development of the business. During 2016, EDPR offered 65 long-term internships and 30 summer internships, of which 12% translated into new hires. Moreover, in 2016 EDPR hired 158 employees, 31% of whom were women. Non-discrimination and equal opportunities are enshrined in our selection processes. This is reflected in the Code of Ethics, which contains specific clauses on non-discrimination and equal opportunities, in line with the companyâ€™s culture of diversity.  INTEGRATION Among our initiatives to integrate new staff we include our Welcome Day, a three-day event for new hires, which allows them to gain basic knowledge about the company and our business. Depending on the employeeâ€™s profile, we offer them a visit to one of the wind farms or the remote dispatch center.  PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS The EDP Group uses a 70.20.10 development model in which not only the theoretical training but also initiatives related to on-the-job experience and teamwork are crucial for the development.

FLEXIBILITY As part of our value proposition at EDPR, we offer a competitive remuneration package, aligned with the best practices in the market. The general remuneration policy incorporates particular features of each geography and is sufficiently flexible so that it can be adapted to the specific needs of each region. The fixed remuneration is supplemented by a variable bonus that depends on an evaluation that measures individual, area and company KPIs. In addition, we understand the importance of maintaining a work-life balance. This has led to an increase in employeeâ€™s satisfaction while bolstering productivity and morale. At EDPR, the Work-Life Balance (WLB) is not just aimed at employees with children, it is a set of initiatives to promote a positive working environment in which employees can advance in their professional career and give their best. We believe that WLB must be a shared responsibility. We seek to constantly improve our WLB measures and provide the most suitable benefits to employees. In fact, we often design WLB benefits that are tailored to the countries where EDPR operates. EDPRâ€™s WLB practices have been awarded for five years now the Responsible Family Employer Certification (EFR Empresa Familiarmente Responsable) by Spain's MÃ¡sFamilia Foundation. In this regard, EDPR has been promoted into the â€œProactive Companyâ€ category, which reflects our commitment to promoting a healthy work-life balance for our employees.  CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 2016 A hallmark of EDPR is its ongoing commitment to seek new initiatives, programs and measures to make our company a great place to work. This commitment to improve our HR management, making sure that employees consider the company a challenging place, where they are willing to give their best by combining high standards of excellence with efficiency, a company in which listening to employees' helps us stand out from the competition, in short, making EDPR a special place to work. In November 2015, EDP launched a new edition of its Climate Survey, which constituted another communication channel to learn the opinions and viewpoints of our employees. Participation rates were very high as 93% of EDPR employees have taken part in the survey, making the results representative of the general climate, as well as providing insight on an individual level. The results reflect high overall levels of commitment (72%), in line with those of EDP (75%) and other leading companies employing the best practices in this area (73%). Of particular note, the most highly valued aspects by employees include job stability, working conditions and working environment. However, closer examination reveals improvement opportunities in certain areas, which today represent the foundations of our Climate Action Plan 2016, which comprises 13 specific actions. These measures have been conveyed to all employees via various platforms.  81  81   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  3.2.2.

Along with the economic benefit to the county and community, there is a significant environmental benefit as well. Now that the project is up and running it will be providing enough energy to power approximately 55,000 average Texan homes every year.  LOCAL HIRING AND PROCUREMENT PRACTICES Although there are no in-house procedures explicitly requiring local recruitment, a high percentage of our employees and 99% of the purchases come from the locations in which the company operates. As a result, we contribute to the local economic development. For operational activities, we usually hire members of the local community for the operation and maintenance services of the wind farms, such as wind farm management, wind turbines operation and maintenance, electrical and civil works maintenance, environmental surveillance and other support services. These practices let us benefit from local workers specific knowledge.  COMMUNITY PROJECTS EDPR voluntarily promotes and supports social, cultural, environmental and educational initiatives with the purpose of contributing to the sustainable development of its business and in order to uphold its strategic vision.

SUPPLIERS EDPRâ€™s value creation capacity, leadership in its business areas and relationship with its stakeholders is significantly influenced by the performance of its suppliers. EDPR bases its relationship with suppliers on trust, collaboration and creation of shared value. This results in a joint capacity to innovate, strengthen sustainability policy and improve quality of operations. EDPR SUPPLY CHAIN During 2016 an extensive characterization study of EDPRâ€™s purchases was developed, aiming a deeper knowledge about the economic, social and environmental impacts of EDPRâ€™s supply chain. EDPR expects from now on to use these results for better definition of the priorities concerning sustainability management. A supplier is considered critical through an added critical awareness score that accounts multiple criteria: annual value spend; supply frequency; access to customers; access to technical equipment or sensitive data; supplier substitutability; component substitutability; supply failure consequence; supplier segmentation; safety risks and environmental risks. and obligations, e.g. through supply or service failure consequences, are the concerns of the identification process. From the point of view of criticality for the business, EDPRâ€™s suppliers segments are: â€¢ Critical suppliers: Turbines, BOP (Balance of Plant) and O&M (Operation and Maintenance), and; â€¢  Non-critical suppliers: indirect purchases.  A new Sustainable Procurement Policy was defined and improvements were introduced in the suppliersâ€™ management process. EDPR is reinforcing out audit procedures and will implement a significantly higher number of audits to suppliers.  Over  5,060  (1)  suppliers contribute to EDPR success  52(2) suppliers are considered as critical  Critical suppliers represent  55%  (3)  of the invoiced volume in Europe and  67%(3)  in North America  99%(1)  Local Purchases  (Purchases in countries of operation of EDPR)  SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN EDPR has defined policies, procedures and standards to ensure the several aspects that fill in with the sustainability of the supply chain, as 1well as the management and mitigation of any type of environmental, social or ethical risks in the supply chain.  PRO GRES S Sustainable Procurement Policy  2016  EDP Group has defined a Sustainable Procurement Policy, which is the framework for the procurement process. The policy includes aspects of law compliance, environmental policy, respect for communities, communication with stakeholders, ethics, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, human rights and health and safety. EDPR works with mature suppliers and companies that look to meet the demanding requirements on quality, environment and prevention, as well as to comply with the economical/financial solvency requirements. 1 2 3  Based on # of purchase orders placed in 2016 Critical suppliers as defined as per EDP formal corporate standard methodology Based on the total invoiced volume in 2016  85  85   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  Policies, Procedures and Standards â€¢  Procurement  During 2016, an extensive characterization study of EDPRâ€™s purchases was developed, aiming a deeper knowledge about the economic, social and environmental impacts of EDPRâ€™s supply chain.  â€¢  EDPR takes into account the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact and Ethical Code acceptance, the Health & Safety and Quality certificates, as well as technical quality and economical/financial solvency of suppliers.  â€¢  Procurement  EDPR has a Procurement Manual, which includes sustainability principles to be taken into account when contracting products or services.  â€¢  These principles summarize the most relevant aspects for EDPR in terms of sustainability in the supply chain: health and safety, respect for the environment, ethics, local development and innovation.  â€¢  EDPR is governed under a strong sense of ethics and requires its suppliers to have no conflicts with the companyâ€™s ethical standards.

For all suppliers considered as critical (regardless of the purchase volume) EDPR ensures from the bidding to the time of providing the service (work execution or maintenance) the compliance of technical quality, economical/financial solvency, and health, safety and environmental management.  86 86   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL OR ETHICAL RISKS EDPR monitors critical suppliers during their services delivery, taking into account aspects as quality, safety, health and environment (waste management, oil spills, etc.). EDPR also ensures the compliance with standards, commitments and procedures of EDPR in all value chain. A) During the execution phase, the construction manager works closely with a health supervisor, a safety and environmental supervisor and holds weekly meetings with suppliers (BOP contractor and, where applicable, the turbine supplier). Contractors receive feedback and improvement plans are established in the areas of quality, health, safety and environment through performance reports. In addition, the company also has external supervision in these areas. B) During the wind farms operation phase, the wind farm manager is responsible for service quality and compliance with the rules and health, safety and environmental procedures. These processes are reinforced by the management systems according to OSHAS 18001 and ISO 14001. Contractors integrate these management systems, as their performance in these areas is crucial for EDPR.  Suppliers share with EDPR their new solutions, products or upgrades to improve collaboration between both parties.  EDPR uses applications for health and safety and environmental management, including regulatory and obligation tracking, which work as collaborative tools therefore involving the entire organization and suppliers to prevent work and environmental accidents. In addition, in the wind farms are carried out drills regarding health and safety and environmental accidents or incidents. The relevant aspects for EDPR in relation to sustainability in the supply chain are Innovation, Health and Safety, Respect for the Environment, Ethics and Local Development. These aspects are expressed in Procurement Manual.  83% of EDPRâ€™s critical suppliers have Occupation Health & Safety System (OHS) (Critical suppliers as defined as per EDP formal corporate standard methodology).  13,156 Hours of training on OHS to EDPRâ€™s Suppliers, involving 165 companies and 2,227 workers. 1,052 Audits to Suppliers in the scope of OHS.

MEDIA Mass media organizations around the world represent a very important stakeholder group to EDPR. EDPRâ€™s corporate reputation and brand visibility depends on media organizations, which is why we take great care in each interaction we have with them. We keep all media organizations informed about the initiatives that the company carries out, whether these are related to financial issues, company performance, corporate social responsibility or any other relevant happenings. For that purpose, the Department of Communication and Stakeholders Management has developed a series of communication channels to make the transmission of information as dynamic and fluid as possible. One of the main channels is the corporate website (www.edpr.com), which includes three large sections dedicated to media: news, where all the companyâ€™s official communications are publicized; media center, a content repository where the media can obtain photographs, videos and other materials; and finally, contact information. Other media communication channels are press conferences, interviews with company managers and conference calls. In 2016, interactions with the media generated news primarily in the markets of Portugal, Spain, North America, Poland and Italy, but generally, in all markets where we operate. These news reflect the companyâ€™s strategy for each of these markets. Portugal was the largest source of the news items, with notable positive coverage of EDPRâ€™s image, including information about the companyâ€™s share price, financial performance, our partnership with China Three Gorges (CTG), education initiatives, plans for expansion and investment (especially foreign investment), new contracts and energy production data. In Spain, the companyâ€™s expansion plans were especially noteworthy, while in the United States and Canada, news tended to focus mostly on Power Purchase Agreements (PPA).  88 88   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  3.3. Safety First Zero accidents mindset Guaranteeing the health, safety and well-being of our employees and contractors is a top priority at EDPR and this commitment is supported by our Health and Safety policy. At EDPR, we are conscious that we work in a sector that is particularly sensitive to the occupational risk, therefore we place special emphasis on prevention by training, communicating and certifying our facilities. As an integral part of our health and safety strategy, employees participate in training courses and risk assessment activities based on the potential risks associated with their position. Our employees follow the guidelines rigorously and strive to achieve a safe workplace for all those who provide services in our facilities. Health & Safety committees and subcommittees throughout EDPR support the implementation of health and safety measures by means of collecting information from different operational levels and involving employees with the establishment and communication of a preventative plan. In order to achieve our zero accidents target, EDPR has implemented health and safety management systems based on the OSHAS 18001:2007 specifications. The standards and procedures of these systems are adapted to the specificities of each geography where they are implemented and are developed based on the countryâ€™s regulation and industryâ€™s best practices. Our commitment to the health and safety of our employees and contractors is further supported through the OHSAS 18001 certification and we are working actively to have all installed capacity certified by 2020.

The objective is to validate this concept both technical and commercially, to allow the definition of the business case for a real size project based on wind and solar resources complementarity. CPV-LAB Project A test platform embedded in a commercial photovoltaic power plant under construction in Portugal, to evaluate the performance of new photovoltaic technologies such as CPV, glass-glass and bifacial, with the objective of gaining experience and creating solid knowledge in order to maximize profitability in future investments.  Energy Storage Battery energy storage is a relevant source of flexibility that will play an important role in renewables development and integration, since it can balance power variability and supply more economically to the grid. In addition, the rapidly falling cost of batteries provides particular interest for EDPRâ€™s future investments in energy storage. The â€˜Stocareâ€™ demonstration project, embedded in Cobadin wind power plant, is the first one to use Lithium ion batteries for electricity storage in Romania and also marks the beginning of using combined energy storage solutions and renewable power generation in EDPR, since the end of 2016. Cobadinâ€™s 1MW/1MWh energy storage system supplied by Siemens works as a proof of concept, aiming to evaluate its potential to enhance renewables power plants economics and integration in the electrical system. The innovative energy management and control platform now being developed aims to provide solutions that respond to output fluctuations in energy production and test new forms of power control under real conditions to maximize yield, besides obtaining operational experience and knowledge from testing different use cases, allowing EDPR to evaluate the future business case by calculating the overall costs, revenues and savings, alongside with risks and opportunities identification. Benefits from this project will result from the reduction of forecast errors from the active power schedule submitted day-ahead to reduce balancing costs and an advanced curtailment management to minimize energy losses. In addition, as remuneration schemes for ancillary services become increasingly available in certain markets, it also aims to test applications such as frequency regulation and voltage support, through the development of algorithms and optimization of control schemes that could later be used in other projects and markets.  Operation and Maintenance The maturity of the wind onshore market, with a growing amount of operating capacity and with turbines becoming increasingly complex, highlights to EDPR the need to devote more efforts to advanced O&M solutions and strategies aimed at achieving cost reduction and increase energy yield due to enhanced data analysis and O&M procedures. With so many sources, volumes and variety of data available, significant innovation efforts are required to properly treat and analyze such wealth of information to create added value knowledge in asset operations. EDPR is starting to incorporate big data technologies using advanced analytics predictive models for wind turbines lifetime optimization and to build reliable and streamlined endof-life strategies. EDPR is also involved in several initiatives to enable predictive maintenance, related with the use of new enhanced sensors, condition monitoring systems and airborne drones for inspection to open new possibilities for data collection.  93 93    4 Sustainability  Materiality Assessment  99  Economic Performance  101  Environmental Performance  105  Social Performance  114  Reporting Principles  132  External Checks  133   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  96   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  97   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  16  40   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  4 Sustainability  4.1. Materiality Assessment (G4-18, G4-20, G4-21, G4-26, G4-27) The macro-economic context, where the challenges of sustainability are increasing, summing up with the diversity of EDPRâ€™s stakeholders, results in a large and complex list of important issues, which must be prioritized according to its relevance and significance. An issue is considered material when it influences the decision, the action and the performance of an organization and its stakeholders.  4.1.1. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES EDPRâ€™s material issues were identified and the results achieved supported the preparation of this Annual Report, as reflected in the companyâ€™s management strategy and, in particular, in its agenda for sustainability.  4.1.2. METHODOLOGY The methodology adopted is based on the Accountability standards and information is collected corporately and in business units. Materiality is obtained by the interception of the issues identified by stakeholders with the importance given internally by the business. The topics identified by the company are prioritized according to the frequency with which they appear in different categories analysed. RELEVANCE FOR SOCIETY The relevance for society is determined by the importance/impact of a specific theme from a perspective external to the company, designated as society perspective. Therefore the society vision reflects the vision of the several stakeholder groups that have influence on or are influenced by EDPRâ€™s activities. This vision must be obtained through sources that ensure independence from the company by means of collecting on most cases external data. In parallel, the establishment of a society vision is also supported by documents, analysis and international/national specific studies that allow a broad perspective of the emerging trends in the sustainability area. Consequently, the company considers that the vision of the several stakeholders reflects the vision of society, thus allowing the assessment of the expectations outside EDPR. RELEVANCE FOR BUSINESS The vision of the business is obtained through the evaluation of the importance/impact of a specific theme from a perspective internal to the company. This vision is originated from the analysis of the defined business strategic goals as these depict the current positioning and concerns of EDPR and reflects the future vision of the business. RESULTS (G4-18, G4-19, G4-20, G4-21, G4-26, G4-27) The materiality matrix describes visually and promptly the most sensitive and impacting themes by comparing the relevance to society with the relevance to the business. The critical and sensitive themes for the business, obtained from the analysis of the materiality matrix, allows the company to drive the strategy and support the decision making process as well as to focus the report of information based on shared interests between company and stakeholder, thus facilitating the relationship among them.  99  99   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  Materiality Matrix  +  Promotion of Renewable Energies' Production  New Business Opportunities  Water Consumption  Biodiversity Climate Change  Environmental Management Responsible and Transparent Communication/Marketing  Citizenship  Corporate Governance  Attractiveness and Talent Retention  Importance for Society  Electricity and Gas Supply  Universal Access to Energy  Corporate Ethics  Working Conditions  Health and Safety Supply Chain Management  Financials / Operating Profit and Tax Transparency Risk Management  Macroeconomic Environment Local Communities R&D+I  Human Rights  -  100  Importance for Business  +   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  4.2.

Source: IRENA  Human activities are releasing critical amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG), which trap heat and steadily drive up our planetâ€™s temperature, eventually compromising our climate. As anthropogenic GHG result primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, effective action in the energy sector is, consequentially, essential to tackle climate change issues. According to IRENA reaching a 30% renewables share by 2030, coupled with higher energy efficiency, would be enough to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2Â°C above preindustrial levels. It is becoming increasingly clear that the investments required to reduce emissions will be modest in comparison with the benefits from avoided climate change damages. Therefore, renewable energy is a cornerstone for achieving climate targets and onshore wind, because of its maturity and competitiveness, is expected to be at the forefront of the required transformation of our energy sector. â€¢  Reducing electricity price When wind production is available, the market price goes down, for the same level of electricity demand and up to 15 times.

G4 EN19 - REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS Our core business activity inherently implies the reduction GHG emissions. Wind and solar energy has zero carbon emissions, contributing to the worldâ€™s fight against climate change and does not produce harmful SOx, NOx, or mercury emissions, protecting valuable air and water resources. We estimated that our activities avoided the emission of 20,078 thousand tons of CO2. Our emissions represent 0.1% of the total amount of emissions avoided and 53% of our total emissions are from the necessary electricity consumption by the wind farms. Even though our activity is based on the clean energy generation, we are conscious about promoting a culture of rational use of resources. During 2016, we continued promoting initiatives that foster environmental best practices in our offices. In 2016, 100% of the emissions related to electricity consumption in windfarms and offices in Spain and US have been compensated by the certifications of origin and RECs obtained from our renewable energy generation. As a result, there is a reduction in the reported emissions year on year. Note: To calculate the emissions avoidance, the energy generation has been multiplied by the CO2 eq emission factors of each country and state within the US. We considered the emission factor of just fossil fuel energy, as we considered that by increasing the generation of renewable energy, we are displacing these technologies, while other renewable technologies and nuclear plants will continue with its quota of generation.  G4 EN23 - TOTAL WEIGHT OF WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHOD The main contribution to the hazardous waste produced by wind farms is related to oil and oil-related wastes such as oil filters or oil containers, used mainly for lubrication of the turbines. The consumption of this oil is based on certain predefined replacement time frequencies (between 2 and 5 years, based on the component, oil type and manufacturer). During 2016, the recovery rate was 87% impacted by a significant spill with a volume of 65 metric tons of soil contaminated. Excluding this fact the recovery rate would have been 97% which certifies that the company has been actively working to improve the recycling rate of its hazardous wastes, through authorized waste haulers. As a reminder, the increase in hazardous wastes in 2015 was mainly due to the contamined soil driven by a significant spill. This soil was removed and fully restored. The increase in non-hazardous wastes in 2015 was driven by metals and glassfiber from 2 nacelles burned. These metals where fully recovered. On the basis of these pick values during the previous year, both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes in 2016 have decreased.  110 110   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  The following table summarizes the amount wastes generated per GWh in our facilities and the rate of recycling.The following table summarizes the amount wastes generated:  2016  2015  (%)  Total waste (kg/GWh)  48.8  72.8  -33%  Total hazardous waste (kg/GWh)  26.4  32.7  -19%  %of hazardous waste recovered  87%  73%  18%  2016  2015  1,195  1,556  647  700  -7%  84  186  -55%  563  514  10%  Waste generated by EDPR  Waste generated by EDPR  1  (%)  1  Total waste (t) Total hazardous wastes (t) Total hazardous waste disposed (t) Total hazardous waste recovered (t) Total non-hazardous wastes (t)  -23%  547  856  -36%  Total non-hazardous waste disposed (t)  227  608  -63%  Total non-hazardous waste recovered (t)  320  248  29%  Annual fluctuations in hazardous waste generated are heavily dependent on the pluri-annual oil replacement programs above mentioned.

We performed a limited assurance review on the non-financial information contained in EDP RenovÃ¡veis, S.A., (hereinafter EDP RenovÃ¡veis) Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 (hereinafter Ê»the ReportÊ¼). The information reviewed corresponds specifically to the GRI indicators described in chapters 03 Execution and 04 Sustainability. EDP RenovÃ¡veis management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Report in accordance with the core option stated by the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, GRI G4 version, of the Global Reporting Initiative as described in section 4.6.2 of the Report. The Report follows the Materiality Matters Check criteria, which had been confirmed by the Global Reporting Initiative. Management is also responsible for the information and assertions contained within the Report; for determining its objectives in respect of the selection and presentation of sustainable development performance, including the processes for determining the material issues and the key stakeholder groups; and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported performance information is derived. Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the work performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and also in accordance with the guidance set out by the Instituto de Censores Jurados de Cuentas de EspaÃ±a (ICJCE). These standards require that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material misstatement. KPMG applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Internal Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. Our limited assurance engagement consisted of making enquiries of management and persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures. These procedures included:  â€¢  Verification of EDP Renovaveis processes for determining the material issues, and the participation of stakeholder groups therein.  â€¢  Interviews with relevant staff at group level and selected business unit level concerning sustainability strategy and policies and corporate responsibility for material issues, and the implementation of these across the business.  â€¢  Evaluation through interviews concerning the consistency of the description of the application of EDP Renovaveis policies and strategy on sustainability, governance, ethics and integrity.

Our multidisciplinary team included specialists in social, environmental and economic business aspects. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement.

Our conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this Independent Review Report. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions. Based on the limited assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information presented in the EDP Renovaveis Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 is not prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines version 4.0 of the Global Reporting Initiative, as described in point G4-32 of the GRI Index, including the reliability of data, adequacy of the information presented and the absence of significant deviations and omissions.

II. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION  A. COMPOSITION 15. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MODEL EDPR is a Spanish Company listed in a regulated stock exchange in Portugal. EDP RenovÃ¡veisâ€™ corporate organization is subject to its personal law and to the extent possible, to the recommendations contained in the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code, (â€œCÃ³digo de Governo das Sociedadesâ€) approved by the ComissÃ£o do Mercado de Valores MobiliÃ¡rios (CMVM - Portuguese Securities Market Commission) in July 2013. This governance code is available to the public at CMVM website (www.cmvm.pt).  146 146   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  The organization and functioning of EDPR corporate governance model aims to achieve the highest standards of corporate governance, business conduct and ethics referenced on the best national and international practices in corporate governance. EDPR has adopted the governance structure currently in effect in Spain. It comprises a General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting and a Board of Directors that represents and manages the Company. As required by law and the Articles of Association, the Companyâ€™s Board of Directors has set up four committees. These are the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee and the Related-Party Transactions Committee. In order to ensure a better understanding of EDPR corporate governance by its shareholders, the Company publishes its updated Articles of Association as well as its Committees Regulations at www.edprenovaveis.com. The governance model of EDPR was designed to ensure the transparent and meticulous separation of duties and the specialization of supervision. EDPRâ€™ bodies for the management and supervision model are the following: ï‚·  General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting  ï‚·  Board of Directors  ï‚·  Executive Committee  ï‚·  Audit and Control Committee  ï‚·  External auditor  The purpose of the choice of this model is to adapt, to the extent possible, the Companyâ€™s corporate governance structure to the Portuguese legislation. The governance model adopted by EDPR therefore seeks, as far as it is compatible with its personal law, to correspond to the so-called â€œAnglo-Saxonâ€ model set forth in the Portuguese Commercial Companies Code, in which the management body is the Board of Directors, and the supervision and control duties are of the responsibility of an Audit and Control Committee. The experience of institutional operating indicates that the governance model approved by EDPR shareholders, and adopted in EDPR, is appropriate to the corporate organization of its activity, especially because it affords transparency and a healthy balance between the management functions of the Executive Committee, the supervisory functions of the Audit and Control Committee and oversight by different Board of Directors special committees. The institutional and functional relationship between the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee and the other Non-Executive members of the Board of Directors has been of internal harmony conductive to the development of the Companyâ€™s business.  16. RULES FOR THE NOMINATION AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS According to Article 29.5 of the Companyâ€™s Articles of Association, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to advise and inform the Board regarding the appointments (including by cooption), re-elections, dismissals and remuneration of Board Members and of its duties, as well as regarding the composition of the several Committees of the Board. The Committee also advises on the appointment, remuneration and dismissal of top management officers. The Committee proposes the appointment and re-election of the Directors and of the members of the various Committees by presenting a proposal with the names of the candidates that considers have the best qualities to fulfil the role of Board Member. Following the best Corporate Governance practices, during 2016 EDPR considered and discussed about the possible criteria applicable in the selection of the new members of its Governing Bodies. As a conclusion, within others, it was considered appropriate to take into account for this purpose the following: the education, experience in the energy sector, integrity and independence, having a proven expertise and the diversity that such candidate may provide to the related body. Based on this, the Board of Directors submits a proposal to the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting, which should be approved by majority for an initial period of three (3) years and may re-elect these members once or more times for further periods of three (3) years. Pursuant to Articles 23 of the Articles of Association and 243 of the Spanish Companies Law, shareholders may group their shares until constituting an amount of capital equal or higher than the result of dividing the companyâ€™s capital by  147  147   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  the number of Members of the Board, and in such case said shareholders are entitled to appoint a number of Directors equal to the result of the fraction using only whole amounts. Those shareholders making use of this power, cannot intervene in the nomination of the other members of the Board of Directors. In case of a vacancy, pursuant to Articles 23 of the Articles of Association and 244 of the Spanish Companies Law, the Board of Directors may co-opt a shareholder, who will occupy the position until the next General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting, to which a proposal will be submitted for the ratification of said co-option. Pursuant to Article 248 of the Spanish Companies Law, the co-option of Directors must be approved by absolute majority of the Directors at the meeting.  17. COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Pursuant to Articles 20 and 21 of the Companyâ€™s Articles of Association, the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than five (5) and no more than seventeen (17) Directors. The term of office shall be of three (3) years, and may be reelected once or more times for equal periods. The number of Board Members was established in seventeen (17) members according to the decision of the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting held on June 21st 2011. The current members of the Board of Directors are:  Board Member  Position  Date of first appointment  Date of re-election  End of term  AntÃ³nio Mexia  Chairman  18/03/2008  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  Vice-Chairman, CEO  18/03/2008  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  Nuno Alves  Director  18/03/2008  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  Miguel Dias Amaro  Director  05/05/2015  -  09/04/2018  Gabriel Alonso  Director  21/06/2011  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  JoÃ£o Paulo Costeira  Director  21/06/2011  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  JoÃ£o Lopes Raimundo  Director  04/06/2008  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  JoÃ£o Manso Neto  JoÃ£o Manuel de Mello Franco  Director  04/06/2008  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  Jorge Santos  Director  04/06/2008  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  Manuel MenÃ©ndez MenÃ©ndez  Director  04/06/2008  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  Gilles August  Director  14/04/2009  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  AcÃ¡cio Piloto  Director  26/02/2013  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  AntÃ³nio Nogueira Leite  Director  26/02/2013  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  JosÃ© Ferreira Machado  Director  26/02/2013  09/04/2015  09/04/2018  Allan J.

EXECUTIVE, NON-EXECUTIVE AND INDEPENDENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EDPRâ€™s Articles of Association, which are available for consultation on the Companyâ€™s website (www.edprenovaveis.com), contain the rules on independence for the fulfilment of duties in any body of the Company. The independence of the Directors is evaluated according to the Companyâ€™s personal law, the Spanish law. Despite the current CMVM recommendations do not specifically require a minimum of independent members within the Board of Directors, and only recommends to take into account some criteria as the adopted governance model, the size  148 148   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  of the Company, its shareholder structure and the relevant free float; Article 12 of EDPRâ€™s Board of Directors regulations requires that at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the Members of the Board shall be independent. Article 20.2 of EDPRâ€™s Articles of Association defines independent members of the Board of Directors as those who are able to perform their duties without being limited by relations with the Company, its significant Shareholders, or its management officers and comply with the other legal requirements. In addition, pursuant to Article 23 of the Articles of Association, the following may not be Directors: ï‚·  People who are directors of or are associated with any competitor of EDPR, as well as those persons that have family relations with those directors. A Company shall be considered to be a competitor of EDPR, whenever it is engaged, if it is directly or indirectly involved in the production, storage, transport, distribution, marketing or supply of electricity or fuel gas and also those that have interests opposed to those of EDPR, a competitor or any of the companies in its group, and board members, employees, lawyers, consultants, or representatives of any of them. Under no circumstances shall companies belonging to the same group as EDPR, including abroad, be considered competitors;  ï‚·  People who are in any other situation of incompatibility or prohibition under the law or EDPRâ€™s Articles of Association. Under Spanish law, people, who are i) aged under eighteen (18) years, (ii) disqualified, iii) competitors, (iv) convicted of certain offences, or (v) hold certain management positions, among others, are not allowed to be Directors.  The Chairman of EDPRâ€™s Board of Directors does not have executive duties. In accordance with the law and pursuant the last amendment of Articles of Association, it has been established that the Non-Executive Directors can only be represented in the Board meetings by other Non-Executive Director. The following table includes the executive, non-executive and independent members of the Board of Directors.

POWERS AND DUTIES 37. PROCEDURES FOR HIRING ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR In EDPR there is a policy of pre-approval by the Audit and Control Committee for the selection of the External Auditor and any related entity for non-audit services, according to Recommendation IV.2 of the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code. This policy was strictly followed during 2016. The services, other than auditing services, provided by the External Auditor and entities in a holding relationship with or incorporated in the same network as the External Auditor were previously approved by the Audit and Control Committee according to Article 8.2, b) of its Regulations and upon review of each specific service, which considered the following aspects: (i) such services having no effect on the independence of the External Auditor and any safeguards used; and (ii) the position of the External Auditor in the provision of such services, notably the External Auditorâ€™s experience and knowledge of the Company. Furthermore, although hiring services other than auditing services to the External Auditor is admissible, it is envisaged as an exception. In 2016 such services reached only around 2.9% of the total amount of services provided to the Company.  38. OTHER DUTIES OF THE AUDIT AND CONTROL COMMITTEE Apart from the competences expressly delegated on the Audit and Control Committee according to Article 8 of its Regulations and in order to safeguard the independence of the External Auditor, the following powers of the Audit and Control Committee were exercised during the 2016 financial year and should be highlighted: â€¢  Appoint and hire the External Auditor and responsibility for establishing their remuneration as well as preapproval of any services to be hired from the External Auditor and perform its direct and exclusive supervision;  â€¢  Assessment of the qualifications, independence, and performance of the External Auditors, and obtaining, yearly and directly from the External Auditors, written information on all relations existing between the Company and the Auditors or associated persons, including all services rendered and all services in progress. In order to evaluate independence, the Audit Committee, obtained the information regarding External Auditorsâ€™ independence in light of the Spanish Royal-Decree no. 1/2011 of July 1st 2011;  â€¢  Review of the transparency report, signed by the Auditor and disclosed at its website. This report covers the matters provided for under Spanish Royal-Decree no. 1/2011 of July 1st 2011, including those regarding the quality control internal system of the audit firm and the quality control procedures carried out by the competent authorities;  â€¢  Definition of the Companyâ€™s hiring policy concerning persons who have worked or currently work with the External Auditors;  â€¢  Review, with the External Auditors, of the scope, planning, and resources to be used in their services;  â€¢  Responsibility for the settlement of any differences between the Executive Committee and the External Auditors concerning financial information;  â€¢  Contracts signed between EDPR and its Qualified Shareholders that were analyzed by the Audit and Control Committee. This information is included on the annual report of the Audit and Control Committee regarding those cases that needed a previous opinion from the committee.  Within this context, it should be particularly stressed that the External Auditorâ€™s independence was safeguarded by the implementation of the Companyâ€™s policy for the pre-approval of the services to be hired to External Auditors (or any entity in a holding relationship with or incorporating the same network as the External Auditors), which results from the application of the rules issued by the European Union on this matter. According to such policy, the Audit and Control Committee makes an overall pre-approval of the services proposal made by the External Auditors and a specific preapproval of other services that will eventually be provided by the External Auditors, particularly, tax consultancy services and services other than â€œaudit and audit relatedâ€ services.  161  161   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  IV-V.

EDPR provides the Group workers with a channel enabling them to report directly and confidentially to the Audit and Control Committee any practice presumed illicit or any alleged accounting and/or financial irregularity in their Company, in compliance with the provisions of CMVM Regulation no. 4/2013. With this channel for reporting irregular accounting and financial practices, EDPR aims to: â€¢  Guarantee conditions that allow workers to freely report any concerns they may have in these areas to the Audit and Control Committee;  â€¢  Facilitate the early detection of irregular situations, which, if practiced, might cause serious damage to the EDPR Group, its workers, customers and shareholders.  Contact with the Companyâ€™s Audit and Control Committee is only possible by email and post, and access to information received is restricted. Any complaint addressed to the Audit and Control Committee will be kept strictly confidential and the whistle-blower will remain anonymous, provided that this does not prevent the investigation of the complaint. He/she will be assured that  164 164   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  the Company will not take any retaliatory or disciplinary action as a result of exercising his/her right to blow the whistle on irregularities, provide information, or assist in an investigation. The Secretary of the Audit and Control Committee receives all the communications and presents a quarterly report to the members of the Committee. In 2016 there were no communications regarding any irregularity at EDPR.  ETHICS CHANNEL AND CODE OF ETHICS EDPR has a Code of Ethics published on its intranet and its website, which includes principles like transparency, honesty, integrity, non-discrimination, equal opportunity, and sustainability. The Code of Ethics has been widely circulated among employees of the Group through internal communications mechanisms, individual shipments, delivery to new employees, and intranet publishing. On February 2014, the Board of Directors approved an updated version of the Code of Ethics. There is a strong commitment by the Company in relation to the dissemination and promotion of compliance with the Code available to all employees through training, questionnaires, and open discussions of the findings. To this extent, from March to December 2016, EDP offered an online Ethics training (â€œÃ‰tica EDPâ€) available to all employees of both Europe/Brazil and North America platforms. This course achieved a major participation of around 900 EDPR employees. There is also an Ethics Channel and Ethics Regulation to articulate any specific claims of the Code of Ethics and to resolve doubts on all matters relating to the Code of Ethics. Communications regarding possible breaches of the Code of Ethics are sent to the Ethics Ombudsman, who performs a first analysis, forwarding its conclusions to the Ethics Committee of EDPR, which receives, records, processes, and reports it to the Board of Directors. In 2016 there was one (1) communication to the Ethics Ombudsmen through the Ethics Channel. However, it was not considered as an issue related to the Ethics Code and it will be suggested to be rejected during the next Committee Ethics. The issue has been submitted to the responsible area in order to be analyzed and take the corresponding measures. The Ethics Code is available at our website www.edprenovaveis.com  ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY In order to ensure compliance with the standards of Anti-Corruption Regulation in every geography where EDPR operates, the Company developed in 2014 an Anti-Bribery Policy of application to all EDPR Group, which was approved by its Board of Directors on December 19th 2014. This Anti-Corruption Policy implies a series of new procedures regarding the relationships of EDPR employees with external parties, namely the approval of certain actions regarding hospitality to and from external parties, charitable donations, and sponsorships. This Policy was implemented in the Group in 2015, through the introduction of several approval systems in the corporateâ€™s employee channels in order to ensure transparency and prevent any corrupt business practice, and was communicated to all EDPR employees. Once this implementation was finished, the corresponding training sessions were organized for part of our employees, and made available in the intranet, in order to ensure appropriate knowledge and understanding of the Policy. The Anti-Corruption Policy is available at our website www.edprenovaveis.com  165  165   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  III. INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT 50. INTERNAL AUDIT EDPRâ€™s Internal Audit Department is composed by seven (7) members. The function of EDPRâ€™s Internal Audit is to carry out an objective and independent assessment of the Groupâ€™s activities and of its internal control situation, in order to make recommendations to improve the internal control mechanisms over systems and management processes in accordance with the Groupâ€™s objectives. Additionally, EDPR has a Responsibilities Model and a SCIRF Manual (Internal Control System over Financial Reporting), in which individuals, governing bodies and committees responsible for implementing and managing the internal control system are indicated. The Responsibilities Model includes the functions and main activities in the management and maintenance of the system at all levels of the organization including monitoring activities related to the annual cycle, the implementation of controls and documentation of evidence and supervision activities. The SCIRF Manual incorporates the general principles of the Internal Control System over Financial Reporting as well as the methodology used, the procedures for ensuring the effectiveness of internal control and design of models, documentation, evaluation and reporting. In line with the general principles of the model adopted by EDPR for the management of the SCIRF, the COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission), the responsibility for supervising the Internal Control System lies in the Board of Directors and the Audit and Control Committee. The CEO is accountable before the Board and must ensure the proper functioning and effectiveness of the SCIRF, promoting its design, implementation and maintenance. The Executive Committee must support the CEO in this task, guiding the development of the Entity Level Controls of the Company and the controls in their areas of responsibility, relying when necessary on other levels of the organization. Also, the Senior Managers are responsible for evaluating any deficiencies and implementing appropriate improvement opportunities. To fulfil these responsibilities, EDPRâ€™s Internal Audit offers support and advice for the management and development of the SCIRF.  51. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF INTERNAL AUDIT The Internal Audit function in EDPR Group is a corporate function carried out by the Internal Audit Department, that reports both to the Chairman of EDPRâ€™s Executive Committee and to EDPRâ€™s Audit and Control Committee.  Board of Directors  Executive Committee  Audit and Control Committee  Internal Audit  52. RISK MANAGEMENT EDPRâ€™s Enterprise Risk Management Process is an integrated and transversal management model that ensures the minimization of the effects of risk on EDPR's capital and earnings, as well as the implementation of best practices of Corporate Governance and transparency. The process aligns EDPRâ€™s risk exposure with the companyâ€™s desired risk profile.  166 166   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  The process is closely followed and supervised by the Audit and Control Committee, an independent supervisory body composed of Non-Executive members. Market, counterparty, operational, business and strategic risks are identified and assessed and, following the result of the assessment, Risk Policies are defined and implemented across the company. These policies are aimed to mitigate risks without compromising potential opportunities, thus, optimizing return versus risk exposure. During 2016, EDPR defined the Enterprise Risk Management Framework of the Group and reassessed Operational Risk for the company, executing a bottom-up analysis across all departments, as stated in EDPRâ€™s Operational Risk Policy.  53. RISK MAP Risk Management at EDPR is focused on covering all risks of the company. In order to have a holistic view of risks, they are grouped in Risk Categories, which are Market, Counterparty, Operational, Business and Strategic. The definition of Risk Categories at EDPR is as follows: 1. Market Risk â€“ It refers to the risk to EDPR resulting from movements in market prices. Due to the relationship between wind production and electricity price, production risk is considered within market risk. In particular, market risk are changes in electricity prices, production risk, interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other commodity prices; 2. Counterparty Risk (credit and operational) â€“ Risk that counterparty to a transaction could default before final settlement of the transactionâ€™s cash flows. A direct economic loss would occur if transactions with the counterparty had positive economic value at the time of default. Even in the case of not defaulting, it may not comply with its contract obligations (timing, quality, etc.), implying additional higher costs due to its replacement or to delays in fulfilling the contract; 3. Operational Risk (other than counterparty) â€“ Defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events (such as an increase in equipment default rates, increasing O&M, or natural disasters); 4. Business Risk â€“ Potential loss in the companyâ€™s earnings due to adverse changes in business margins. Such losses can result above all from a serious increase in equipment prices or changes in the regulatory environment. Changes in electricity prices and production are considered market risks; 5. Strategic Risk â€“ It refers to risks coming from macroeconomic, political, social or environmental situation in countries where EDPR is present, as well as those coming from a change in competitive landscape, from technology disruptions, from changes in energy markets or from governance decisions (investment decisions criteria, Corporate Governance and Reputational issues). Within each Risk Category, risks are classified in Risk Groups.  1. Market Risk 1. i) Electricity price risk EDPR faces limited electricity price risk as it pursues a strategy of being present in countries or regions with long-term visibility on revenues. In most countries where EDPR is present, prices are determined through regulated framework mechanisms. In those countries with no regulated tariffs, power purchase agreements are negotiated with different offtakers to eliminate electricity and Green Certificate or Renewable Energy Credit (REC) price risks. Despite EDPRâ€™s strategy of eliminating market price risk, EDPR still has some plants with merchant exposure. In Europe, EDPR operates in countries where the selling price is defined by a feed-in-tariff (Portugal, France and Italy) or in markets where, on top of the electricity price, EDPR receives either a pre-defined regulated premium or a green certificate, whose price is achieved on a regulated market (Spain, Belgium, Poland and Romania). EDPR is also developing investment activity in the UK, where current incentive system is based on green certificates but will change to a feed in tariff.  167  167   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  In countries with a pre-defined regulated premium or a green certificate scheme, EDPR is exposed to electricity price fluctuations. Considering current Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in place, EDPR is exposed to electricity price risk in Romania, in Poland and partially in Spain. Additionally, in European countries with a green certificate scheme (Romania and Poland), EDPR is exposed to fluctuation on the price of green certificates. The US market does not provide a regulated framework system for the electricity price. Nevertheless, renewable generation is incentivized through PTCs (Production Tax Credits) and regional Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) programs that allow receiving RECs for each MWh of renewable generation. REC prices are very volatile and depend on the regional supply/demand equilibrium in the relevant market. Most of EDPRâ€™s capacity in the US has predefined prices determined by bundled (electricity + REC) long-term contracts with local utilities in line with the Companyâ€™s policy of avoiding electricity price risk. Despite existing long term contracts, some EDPRâ€™s plants in the US do not have PPA and are selling merchant with exposure to electricity and REC prices. Additionally, some plants with existing PPAs do not sell their energy where it is produced and are therefore exposed to basis risk (difference in price between the location where energy is produced and that where energy is sold). In Ontario (Canada), the selling price is defined by a long-term feed-in-tariff, thus, there is no electricity price exposure. In Brazilian operations, the selling price is defined through a public auction which is later translated into a long-term contract. Electricity price exposure is almost null, with little exposure for the production above or below the contracted production. Under EDPRâ€™s global approach to minimize the exposure to market electricity prices, the Company evaluates on a permanent basis, if there are any deviations to the pre-defined limits (measured through EBITDA at risk, Net Income at risk and total merchant exposure). EDPR intends to eliminate Green Certificates and REC price risk with the signing of bundled PPAs with private offtakers, which include the sale of the electricity and the Green Certificate or REC. In some cases, the offtaker may be interested in contracting only the Green Certificate or the REC, thus a GCPA (Green Certificate Purchase Agreement) or a RECPA (REC Purchase Agreement) is signed. During 2016, EDPR signed new long-term PPAs in the US for 540 MW. In those geographies with remaining merchant exposure, EDPR uses various commodity-hedging instruments in order to minimize the exposure to fluctuating market prices. In some cases, due to the lack of liquidity of financial derivatives, it may not be possible to successfully hedge all existing merchant exposure, after considering PPAs in place. In 2016 EDPR financially hedged most of its remaining merchant exposure in Poland, Romania, Spain and the US. These hedges protected EDPRâ€™s result from low electricity prices, notable in Spain during the first semester of the year and in US. As aforementioned, some US plants have exposure to REC price risk and/or basis risk (difference in electricity price between locations). EDPR hedges REC prices through forward sales and basis exposures through financial swaps or FTR (Financial Transmission Rights).  1. ii) Energy Production Risk The amount of electricity generated by EDPRâ€™s renewable plants is dependent on weather conditions, which vary across locations, from season to season and from year to year. Variation on the amount of electricity that is generated affects EDPRâ€™s operating results and efficiency. Not only the total wind or solar production in a specific location is relevant, but also the profile of production. Wind usually blows more at night than at daytime, when energy prices are lower and the opposite for solar. Generation profile will affect the discount or add-on in price of a plant versus a baseload generation. Finally, curtailment of a plant will also affect its production. Curtailment occurs when the production of a plant is stopped by the TSO (Transmission System Operators) for external reasons to the Company. Examples of cases of curtailment are upgrades in transmission lines or exceptional congestion (high level of electricity generation for available transmission capacity). EDPR mitigates wind and solar resource volatility and seasonality through geographical diversification of its asset base in different countries and regions.  168 168   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  EDPR acknowledges the correlation between different plants in its portfolio that allows for this geographical diversification, which enables EDPR to partially offset production variations in each region and to keep the total energy generation relatively steady. Currently, EDPR is present in 12 countries: Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, UK (no generation), Italy, US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. EDPR has analysed the potential use of financial products to hedge wind risk and might use this product to mitigate risk in specific cases. Profile risk and curtailment risk are managed ex-ante. For every new investment, EDPR factors the effect that expected generation profile and curtailment will have on the output of the plant. Generation profile and curtailment of EDPRâ€™s plants are constantly monitored by EPDRâ€™s Risk department to detect potential future changes.  1. iii) Risks related to financial markets EDPR finances its plants through project finance or corporate debt. In both cases, a variable interest rate might imply significant fluctuations in interest payments. On the other hand, due to EDPRâ€™s presence in several countries, revenues denominated in different currencies. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on financial results or on the value of the foreign investment.  1. iii) a) Interest rate risk Given the policies adopted by EDPR Group, current exposure to variable interest rate is not significant and financial cash flows are substantially independent from the fluctuation of interest rates. The purpose of interest rate risk management policies is to reduce the exposure of long-term debt cash flows to market fluctuations, mainly by contracting long term debt with a fixed rate. ï‚·  When long-term debt is issued with floating rates, EDPR settles derivative financial instruments to swap from floating to fixed rate.  ï‚·  EDPR has a portfolio of interest-rate derivatives with maturities of up to 13 years. Sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest-rate fluctuations are periodically performed.  With most of interest rate being fixed, main exposure to interest rates arises at refinancing. To protect against this risk, EDPR intends to maintain a balanced maturity profile for its corporate fixed debt, thus, diversifying the risk of bad timing when refinancing occurs. Repricing calendar of debt is continuously monitored together with interest rates in order to detect good timing for restructuring debt. Taking into account risk management policy and approved exposure limits, Global Risk Area supports the Finance team in interest rate hedging decisions and the Finance team submits the financial strategy appropriate to each project/location for Executive Committeeâ€™s approval.  1. iii) b) Exchange rate risk EDPR has international operations and is exposed to the exchange-rate risk resulting from investments in foreign subsidiaries. Currency exposure in operating plants is to U.S. dollar, Romanian leu, Polish zloty, Brazilian real, British pound and Canadian dollar. EDPR hedges risk against currency fluctuations by financing in the same currency as the revenues of the project. When local financing is not available, EDPR hedges debt cash flows though cross currency interest rate swaps. EDPR also hedges net investment (investment after deducting local debt) in foreign currency through cross currency interest rate swaps.  169  169   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  Finally, EDPR contracts foreign exchange forwards to hedge the risk in specific transactions, mainly in payments to suppliers which may be denominated in different currencies. EDPRâ€™s hedging efforts minimize exchange rate volatility, but do not eliminate completely this risk due to high costs associated to hedging FX in certain situations.  1. iii) c) Inflation risk In specific projects, regulated remuneration is linked to inflation. Additionally, O&M costs are considered to be linked to inflation in most cases. Exposure to inflation in revenues may be naturally hedged with exposure to interest rates and EDPR regularly analyses inflation exposure and its relationship with interest rates to adjust level of interest rate coverage in project finance structures. Exposure to inflation in O&M costs is managed at the moment of the investment decisions, by executing sensitivity analyses.  1. iii) d) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of EDPR not meeting its financial obligations. Liquidity risk is mainly related to extreme market movements in electricity prices, interest or exchange rates, which may change the expected cash flow generation. EDPR tracks liquidity risk in the short term (margin calls, etc) and in the long term (financing sources) in order to meet strategic targets previously set (EBITDA, debt ratio and others). EDPRâ€™s strategy to manage liquidity risk is to ensure that its liquidity is sufficient to meet financial liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, and without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to EDPRâ€™s reputation. Different funding sources are used such as Tax Equity investors, multilateral organizations, project finance, corporate debt and asset rotation in order to ensure long-term liquidity to finance planned projects and working capital.  1. iv) Commodity price risk (other than electricity) In projects in which there is a significant number of years between investment decision and start of construction, EDPR may be exposed to the price of the materials used in turbine manufacturing, foundations and interconnection through escalation formulae included in the contracts with suppliers. In order to manage this risk, EDPR may hedge the market exposure in OTC/future commodity markets, considering the risks (potential losses) and the cost of the hedge.  2. Counterparty Risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before the final settlement of the transactionâ€™s cash flows. An economic loss could occur, either a direct economic loss if the transaction has a positive value at the moment of default (counterparty credit risk) or a replacement cost due to change of the counterparty (counterparty operational risk).  2. i) Counterparty Credit Risk If the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default, an economic loss would occur.  170 170   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  To control credit risk at EDPR, thresholds of Expected Loss and Unexpected Loss are established at company level as defined under Basel Standards and re-evaluated monthly. If the threshold is surpassed by the company as a whole, mitigation measures are implemented in order to remain within the pre-established limit. Additionally, Expected Loss limits are established for each individual counterparty or Group of counterparties (parent and subsidiaries).  2. ii) Counterparty Operational Risk If the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty does not have a positive economic value at the time of default, it will impact operations. Despite no direct loss at the time of default, the replacement of the counterparty could imply a cost to EDPR due to potential delays, higher contract value with a new counterparty (replacement costs), etc. Construction and O&M subcontractors are counterparties to which EDPR is exposed from an operational point of view. To minimize the probability of incurring in potential replacement costs with counterparties, EDPRÂ´s policy concerning counterparty operational risk is managed by an analysis of the technical capacity, competitiveness, credit quality and replacement cost of the counterparty.  3. Operational Risk 3. i) Development Risk Renewable plants are subject to strict regulations at different authority levels (international, national, state, regional and local) relating to the development, construction, grid interconnection and operation of power plants. Among other things, these laws regulate landscape and environmental aspects, building licenses, land use and land securing and access to the grid issues. While level of exigency might be different depending on the geographies, EDPR acknowledges a trend for legislations to align towards concentrating the most restrictive rules and development risks on the consenting (environmental and urban permissions) and interconnection (electricity connection of the plant to the national grid). In this context, EDPRâ€™s experience gathered in different countries is useful to anticipate and deal with similar situations in other countries. During the development and design phase, EDPR focuses on the optimization of its projects. By mastering the variables, such as choice of locations, layout, etc, the objective is to make our projects more resilient to permitting risks. Additionally, EDPR mitigates development risk by generating optionality, with development activities in 12 different countries (Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, UK, Italy, US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico) and a portfolio of projects in several stages of maturity. EDPR has a large pipeline of projects that provide a â€œbufferâ€ to overcome potential delays in the development of prioritized projects, ensuring growth targets and being able to compensate permitting delays in some geographies.  3. ii) Execution Risk During the construction of the foundations, interconnection and substation of a plant, and the installation of the equipments, different events (bad weather, accidents, etc) might occur that could imply an over cost or a delay in the commercial operation date of the plant: ï‚·  The delay implies a postponement of cash flows, affecting profitability of the investment.  ï‚·  When a plant has a PPA, a delay of the commercial operation date might imply the payment of LDs, with the consequent loss of revenues and the impact on annual financial results.  During the design phase, EDPR engineering teams supervise the engineering and the installation method. Construction is subcontracted to technically capable construction companies.  171  171   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  In both cases, a critical path analysis is performed to assess the reliability of construction and installation plan. Also, collaterals may be required to the counterparty following EDPRâ€™s Counterparty Risk Policy.  3. iii) Operation Risk  Damage to Physical Assets Renewable plants in construction and in operation are exposed to weather hazards, natural disasters, etc. These risks depend on the location. All plants are insured the physical damage during construction and operation. During operation, any natural disaster, weather hazard or accident will be partially insured to revenue losses due to the event.  Equipment Performance Risk (O&M costs) Output from renewable plants depends upon the operating availability of the equipment. EDPR mitigates this risk by using a mix of suppliers which minimizes technological risk, avoiding exposure to a unique manufacturer. EDPR also engages suppliers through medium-term full-scope maintenance agreements during the first years of operation to ensure alignment with supplier in minimizing technology risk. Finally, for older plants, EDPR has created an Operation and Maintenance (O&M) program with an adequate preventive and scheduled maintenance program. EDPR externalizes non-core technical O&M activities of its renewable plants, while primary and value added activities continue to be controlled by EDPR.  3. iv) Information Technology IT (Information Technologies) risk may occur in the technical network (information network for plants operation) or in the office network (information network of corporate services: ERP, accountingâ€¦) EDPR mitigates this risk creating redundancy of servers and control centers of renewable plants. Redundancy is created in a different location to anticipate potential natural disasters, etc.  3. v) Legal claims (compliance) EDPR faces potential claims of third parties and fraud of its employees. EDPR aims strict compliance with existing regulation and has zero tolerance to fraud. EDPR revises periodically its compliance with all the regulations that affects its activity (environmental, taxesâ€¦)  3. vi) Personnel EDPR identifies two main risk factors regarding personnel: turnover and health and safety. â€¢  Turnover: Cost of replacing an employee. A high turnover implies direct costs of replacement and indirect costs of knowledge loss.  â€¢  Health and safety: Likelihood that a person may be harmed or suffers adverse health effects if exposed to a hazard.  EDPR mitigates turnover through constant reassessment and benchmarking of remuneration schemes in different geographies. Additionally, EDPR offers flexibility to its employees to improve work life balance. In 2016, EDPR was elected as â€œGreat Place to Workâ€ in Spain and Poland.  172 172   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  EDPR aims zero-accidents at work by constantly training in health and safety issues and certifying its facilities according to the OHSAS 18001 standard.  3. vii) Processes Internal processes are subject to potential human errors that may negatively affect the outcome. Internal Audit Department regularly reviews internal processes and recommends the establishment of new controls or the improvement in the implementation of existing procedures. 4. Business Risk  4. i) Regulatory Risk (renewables) The development and profitability of renewable energy projects are subject to policies and regulatory frameworks. The jurisdictions in which EDPR operates provide different types of incentives supporting energy generated from renewable sources. Remuneration schemes have become less competitive in some countries due to the financial crisis and it cannot be guaranteed that current support will be maintained in all EDPRâ€™s geographies or that future renewable energy projects will benefit from current support measures. Regulation promoting green energy has been revised or is under revision in some of the countries where EDPR is present. In the US, renewable generation from wind will be incentivized through Production Tax Credits (PTC) at a Federal level for all projects beginning of construction up to 2019. Level of incentives will be progressively fading out. Additionally, wind and solar production is also incentivized through State RPS Programs that allow receiving RECs (Renewable Energy Credit) for each MWh of renewable generation. EDPR is managing its exposure to regulatory risks through diversification, by being present in several countries and through participation as an active member in several wind and solar associations. Regulatory Risk in each of EDPRâ€™s countries is monitored continuously, considering current regulation, potential drafts of new laws, feedback from associations, evolution of installed renewable generation capacity and other inputs. EDPR has developed an internal quantitative assessment of Regulatory Risk that serves as an indicator for changes in supporting schemes. This measure is updated annually in all EDPRÂ´s geographies. Regulatory Risk is also considered ex-ante, at the moment of the investment, through sensitivity analyses that are performed to evaluate its impact in project profitability under different scenarios.  4. ii) Equipment Market Risk  Equipment Price Risk Price of equipment is affected, not only by market fluctuations of the materials used, but also by the demand of this equipment. For every new project, EDPR secures the demand risk by engaging in advance with manufacturers, elected through a competitive process.  Equipment Supply Risk The demand for new plants may offset the offer of equipment. Currently, the local component requirement in some geographies (Ex: Brazil) may create this shortfall situation.  173  173   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  EDPR faces limited risk to the availability and price increase of equipment due to existing framework agreements with major global suppliers. The Company uses a large mix of suppliers in order to diversify equipment supply risk. For geographies with specific requirements of local component, EDPR does not engage in a project before securing the supply of the equipment. 5. Strategic Risk  5. i) Country Risk Country Risk is defined as the probability of occurrence of a financial loss in a given country due to macroeconomics, political or natural disasters. EDPR has defined a Country Risk Policy that assesses country risk through an internal scoring based on publicly available data. This internal scoring is compared with external assessments from renowned organizations. Each risk factor affecting country risk is evaluated independently to decide on potential mitigating actions: â€¢  Macroeconomic Risk: Risks from the countryâ€™s economic evolution, affecting revenue or cost time of the investments;  â€¢  Political Risk: All possible damaging actions or factors for the business of foreign companies that emanate from any political authority, governmental body or social group in the host country;  â€¢  Natural disaster risk: Natural phenomena (seismicity, weather) that may impact negatively in the business conditions.  Before approving a project in a new geography, EDPR analyses the risk of the new country and compares it to our existing portfolio. Mitigation measures may be decided when this risk is above a certain threshold.  5. ii) Competitive landscape In the renewable business, size can be an advantage or disadvantage in specific situations. For example, in development of renewable plants, small and dynamic companies are usually more competitive than larger companies. On the other hand, when participating in tender processes for offshore wind farms, the size of the investment benefits larger companies. Additionally, the consequences of a change in the competitive landscape due to mergers and acquisitions may also be a risk. To mitigate the risks, EDPR has a clear knowledge of its competitive advantages and tries to leverage on them. When EDPR has no advantage versus its competitors, alternatives are considered in order to become competitive. For example, for offshore wind farms, EDPR has partnered with large companies with previous experience in large electricity generation projects, in order to become a more competitive consortium.  5. iii) Technology disruptions Most renewables are relatively recent technologies, which are continuously evolving and improving efficiency. As such, some initially expensive technologies can become competitive in a relatively short time. EDPR growth focuses in the most competitive renewable technologies at the moment, which are onshore wind, offshore wind and PV solar, but also participates in other innovative projects such as floating offshore wind.  5. iv) Meteorological changes Future estimations of wind and solar production are based on analysis of historical measurements for more than 20 years, and they are considered to be representative of the future. Relevant unexpected meteorological changes could lead to a lower production than the one expected from historical data.  174 174   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  When evaluating a new investment, EDPR considers potential changes in the production forecasted, however, the size of the potential deviation in the case of relevant meteorological changes is uncertain. 5. v) Investment decisions criteria Not all projects have the same risk profile. This will depend on merchant exposure of remuneration, construction risk, etc. In order to take proper business decisions, EDPR uses Risk Adjusted Metrics for investment decisions, which take into consideration the different risks inherent of each project.  5. vi) Energy Planning Assumptions in future evolution of energy markets affect the profitability of the investments for the period after the fixed remuneration (regulated tariff or PPAs). Structure of electricity markets in most of EDPR geographies (marginal setting price) were not designed to consider a great share of generation from renewable sources with zero marginal price. Thus, the increase in renewable generation could lead to lower pool prices in medium term if reforms of electricity markets are not properly undertaken. When investing, EDPR performs sensitivity analyses to stress pool price scenarios for the period without fixed remuneration to understand the robustness of the profitability of the investment.  5. vii) Corporate Organization and Governance Corporate governance systems should ensure that a company is managed in the interests of its shareholders. In particular, EDPR has an organization in place with a special focus on transparency, where the management body (Board of Directors) is separated from the supervision and control duties (Audit and Control Committee). Members of the Audit Committee are invited to the General Risk Committee of EDPR. 5. viii) Reputational risk Companies are exposed to public opinion and todayâ€™s social networks are a rapid mean to express particular opinions. A bad reputation could eventually harm financial results of a company in the short and in the long term. Sustainability makes part of the essence of EDPR. EDPR is not only committed in building a better future for our children, but also in doing it well, in an ethical and sustainable manner, consequently limiting reputational risk. 54. RISK FUNCTIONS AND FRAMEWORK A corporation can manage risks in two different ways, one risk at a time on a largely and compartmentalized basis, or all risks together within a coordinated and strategic framework. The latter approach is called â€œEnterprise Risk Managementâ€ and is the approach used at EDPR. Risk Management at EDPR is supported by three distinct organizational functions, each one with a different role: Strategy (Risk Profiler), Management (Risk Manager) and Controlling (Risk Controller).  175  175   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  Risk functions  Description ï‚·  Management â€“ Risk management & risk business decisions  Controlling â€“ Risk control  ï‚·  Responsible for proposing guidelines and policies for risk management within the company  ï‚·  Implement defined policies by Global Risk  ï‚·  Responsible for day-to-day operational decisions and for related risk taking and risk mitigating positions  ï‚·  Strategy â€“ General risk strategy & policy  Global Risk Department provides analytically supported proposals to general strategic issues  Responsible for follow-up of the results of risk taking decisions and for contrasting alignment of operations with general risk policy approved by the board  The Risk Committee is the forum where the different Risk Functions discuss the policies to be implemented and control the risk exposure of the company. EDPRâ€™s Risk Committee integrates and coordinates all Risk Functions and assures the link between corporateâ€™s risk appetite and defined strategy and the operations of the company. EDPR created three distinct meetings of the Risk Committee in order to separate discussions on execution of mitigation strategies from those on the definition of new policies: ï‚·  Restricted Risk Committee: Held every month, it is mainly focused on development risk and market risk from electricity price (market, basis, profile, GCs and RECs).

DETAILS ON THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED IN THE COMPANY REGARDING THE PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING FINANCIAL INFORMATION With the purpose of not only controlling risks, but also managing them ex-ante, EDPR has created Global Risk policies that are enforceable at a Global Level. These policies are proposed and discussed in the Risk Committee and approved by the Executive Committee. Compliance with Global Risk policies is verified every month in the Restricted Risk Committee. During 2016, EDPR redefined the Enterprise Risk Management Framework for the company, framing all existing risk policies/prodedures under each Risk Category: ï‚· ï‚· ï‚· ï‚·  Market Risk: Energy Price Hedging Policy, FTR participation procedure, US Active Scheduling Procedure. Counterparty Risk: Counterparty Risk Policy. Operational Risk: Operational Risk Policy. Strategic Risk: Country Risk Policy.  INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING EDPR has an Internal Control System over Financial Reporting (SCIRF) updated and monitored in line with international standards of Internal Control. This system covers the main aspects of the COSO framework: maintaining a control environment for the preparation of qualified financial information, assessment of the risks of financial reporting, existence of control activities to mitigate risks of error, information and communication and evaluation mechanisms.  176 176   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  SCOPE REVISION AND UPDATE The SCIRF Manual includes the annual update of the scope that aims to identify companies, areas and processes that must be included in the scope of SCIRF, according to criteria of materiality and risk, including the risk of error or fraud. The risk analysis included in the scoping process for SCIRF, includes both the different types of risk (operational, economic, financial, technological or legal) and the control objectives of financial reporting (existence and occurrence, completeness, measurement, presentation, disclosure and comparability, and rights and obligations in terms of their potential impact on the financial statements). The results of the updated scope with the methodology outlined are communicated at all levels of the organization involved in the SCIRF and supervised by the Audit and Control Committee.  CONTROL ACTIVITIES In documented SCIRF processes and controls, information capture mechanisms are established (including identification of the scope of consolidation) and steps and checks that are carried out for the preparation of the financial information that will be part of consolidated financial statements are specified. The procedures for review and approval of financial information are provided by the areas of Planning and Control, and Administration, Consolidation and Tax. Financial information is supervised in the scope of its competences by the Audit Control Committee, prior to the formulation of the accounts by the Board of Directors. The SCIRF includes control activities related to these processes, embodied in Entity Level Controls, Process Controls and General Computer Controls. These processes include review and approval activities of the financial information which are described in the processes of elaboration of individual accounts, preparation of consolidated accounts and processing of consolidated financial statements. EDPR has descriptions of Competency Profiles for the Positions to be carried out in the exercise of the main features of each position that includes a description of the main responsibilities. These include the descriptions of the key positions of those involved in the preparation of financial information. These descriptions include responsibilities in the preparation of financial information and compliance with internal control procedures. The documentation of processes and associated controls designed include among others, the completion of closure activities by completing monthly closing checklists by entity, setting time limits for the closures, the identification of the relevance of the operations in order to be reviewed at the appropriate level, conducting analytical reviews of financial information, the existence of limitations in systems to prevent erroneous records or access by unauthorized persons, analysis of deviations from the budget, the analysis in Executive Committees of relevant and significant facts that could cause a significant impact on the accounts, or the allocation of responsibilities for calculating amounts to be provisioned for them to be carried out by authorized personnel with the right skills. In addition to the mentioned processes, major transactional processes resulting from the scope are documented. The description of the activities and controls are designed with the aim of ensuring the registration, evaluation, appropriate presentation and disclosure of transactions in financial reporting. Control activities of EDPRâ€™s SCIRF also include those relating to systems and information technology (Computer General Controls) following an international reference, the COBIT framework (Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies). The importance of this area is that information systems are the tools with which financial information is prepared, and is therefore relevant for transactions conducted with them. These control activities include those related to access control to applications and systems, segregation of duties, management of corrective and preventive maintenance, new projects implementation, administration and management of the systems, facilities and operations (back-ups, security incidents) and their proper monitoring and planning. These activities are developed taking into account the requirements of control and supervision. Among the activities of SCIRFâ€™s scope update, there is a periodic analysis of the existence of service suppliers that perform relevant activities in relation to the processes of preparing financial information.  177  177   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  SCIRF SUPERVISION The Audit and Control Committee supervises the SCIRF in the scope of the exercise of their activities through the monitoring and supervision of the developed mechanisms for SCIRFâ€™s implementation, evolution and evaluation, and the results of the scope analysis and the extent of the situation in terms of coverage. To this extent, the Internal Audit Department assists the Audit and Control Committee. EDPR has an Internal Audit Department under the Chairman of the Executive Committee. The Audit and Control Committee supervise the Internal Audit Department as establishes the Basic Internal Audit Act. The main functions of the Internal Audit Department are set out in the Basic Internal Audit Act, which includes, among others, the evaluation of the activities of internal control systems, including the internal control system over financial reporting. The annual work plans of the Internal Audit Department obtain the opinion of the Audit and Control Committee. The Internal Audit Department reports to the Audit and Control Committee about the status and the performance of the audit works. Among these activities, Internal Audit supports the Audit and Control Committee in supervising the implementation and maintenance of SCIRF and reports the results of the evaluation, improvement actions identified and their evolution. The entity has action plans for improvement actions identified in SCIRFâ€™s assessment processes, which are accompanied and supervised by the Internal Audit Department, considering their impact on the financial information. Also in the year 2016, as in previous years, a process of self-certification was made by the heads of the various process owners regarding proper documentation update on SCIRF controls and processes in their area of responsibility and the implementation of controls with corresponding evidence.  SCIRF EVALUATION Besides the monitoring and evaluation activities described in the preceding paragraph, in case the auditors identified internal control weaknesses in the scope of their financial audit work, they are expected to communicate these circumstances to the Audit and Control Committee, which regularly monitors the results of the audit work. Additionally, in 2016 the EDPR Group decided to have its SCIRF audited by the external auditor. As a result of its evaluation, the external auditor issued a report with a favorable opinion on the SCIRF of the EDPR Group, according to ISAE 3000 (International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000).  IV. INVESTOR ASSISTANCE  56. INVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENT EDPR seeks to provide to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders all the relevant information about the Company and its business environment, on a regular basis. The promotion of transparent, consistent, rigorous, easily accessible, and highâ€‘quality information is of fundamental importance to an accurate perception of the Companyâ€™s strategy, financial situation, accounts, assets, prospects, risks, and significant events. EDPR, therefore, looks to provide investors with accurate information that can support them in making informed, clear and concrete investment decisions. The Investor Relations Department was created to ensure a direct and permanent contact with all market related agents and stakeholders, to guarantee effective communication, equality between shareholders and to prevent imbalances in the information access. The EDPR Investor Relations Department (IR) is the intermediary between EDPR and its actual and potential shareholders, the financial analysts that follow Companyâ€™s activity, all investors and other members of the financial  178 178   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  community. The main purpose of the department is to guarantee the principle of equality among shareholders, by preventing asymmetries in the access of the information and reducing the gap between market perception and Companyâ€™s strategy and intrinsic value. The department responsibility comprises developing and implementing EDPRâ€™s communication strategy and preserving an appropriate institutional and informative relationship with the financial market, the stock exchange at which EDPR shares trade and the regulatory and supervisory entities (CMVM â€“ ComissÃ£o de Mercado de Valores MobiliÃ¡rios â€“ in Portugal and CNMV â€“ ComisÃ­on Nacional del Mercado de Valores â€“ in Spain). EDPR is clearly aware of the importance of detailed and transparent information, delivered on-time to the market. Consequently, EDPR publishes Companyâ€™s price sensitive information before the opening or following the closing of the NYSE Euronext Lisbon stock exchange through CMVMâ€™s information system and, simultaneously, make that same information available on the website investorsâ€™ section and through the IR departmentâ€™s mailing list. In 2016, EDPR made 30 press releases, including quarterly, semi-annual and annual results presentations and handouts elaborated by the IR Department. In addition, the IR Department also elaborates key data files and interim presentations which are available on the website investorsâ€™ section. On each earnings announcement, EDPR promotes a conference call and webcast, at which the Companyâ€™s management updates the market on EDPRâ€™s activities. On each of these events, shareholders, investors and analysts had the opportunity to directly submit their questions and to discuss EDPRâ€™s results as well as the Companyâ€™s outlook and strategy. EDPR IR Department is coordinated by Rui Antunes and is located at the Companyâ€™s head offices in Madrid, Spain.

COMPETENCES TO DETERMINE THE REMUNERATION OF THE CORPORATE BODIES The Nominations and Remunerations Committee is a permanent body belonging to the Board of Directors with an informative and advisory nature. Its recommendations and reports are non-binding. As such, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee has no executive functions. The main functions of the Nominations and Remunerations Committee are to assist and inform the Board of Directors regarding the nominations (including by co-option), re-elections, dismissals, and the remuneration of the Board Members and its position about the composition of the Board of Directors, as well as the nominations, remuneration, and dismissal of senior management personnel.

The Board of Directors is responsible for the approval of the above-mentioned proposals except concerning the Declaration on the Remuneration Policy. The Declaration on the Remuneration Policy is submitted by the Board of Directors to the approval of the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting as an independent proposal.

REMUNERATION STRUCTURE  69. REMUNERATION POLICY Pursuant to Article 26.1 of the Companyâ€™s Articles of Association the Directors shall be entitled to a remuneration which consists of (i) a fixed amount to be determined annually by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting for the whole Board of Directors and of (ii) attendance fees regarding the Board Meetings. The above-mentioned article also establishes the possibility of the Directors being remunerated with Company shares, share options, or other securities granting the right to obtain shares or by means of share-indexed remuneration systems. In any case, the system chosen must be approved by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting and comply with current legal provisions. The total amount of the remunerations that the Company will pay to its Directors under the terms provided in the previous paragraphs shall not exceed the amount determined for that effect by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting. The maximum remuneration approved by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting, for all the members of the Board of Directors was EUR 2,500,000 per year. Pursuant to Article 26.4 of the Companyâ€™s Articles of Association, the rights and duties of any kind derived from the condition of Board Member shall be compatible with any other rights and obligations either fixed or variable that could correspond to the Board Members as a consequence of other employment or professional engagements, if any, carried out in the Company. Variable remuneration resulting from said contracts or from any other relationship, including being a Board Member, will be limited to a maximum annual amount to be established by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting. The maximum annual remuneration approved by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting for the variable remuneration for all the executive members of the Board of Directors was EUR 1,000,000 per year. EDPR, in line with EDP Group corporate governance practice, has signed an Executive Management Services Agreement with EDP, under which the Company bears the cost for such services to some of the members of the Board of Directors to the extent their services are devoted to EDPR. The Non-Executive Directors only receive a fixed remuneration, which is calculated on the basis of their work exclusively as Directors or with their membership on the Nominations and Remunerations Committee, Related Party Transactions Committee, and the Audit and Control Committee. Those members who are seated in two different Committees do not accumulate two remunerations. In these cases, the remuneration to be received is the one that corresponds to the highest value. EDPR has not incorporated any share remuneration or share purchase options plans as components of the remuneration of its Directors. No Director has entered into any contract with the Company or third parties that have the effect of mitigating the risk inherent in the variability of the remuneration established by the Company. In EDPR there are not any payments for the dismissal or termination of Director's duties. The remuneration policy for the Directors of the Company is submitted each year to the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting for approval.  70. REMUNERATION STRUCTURE The remuneration policy applicable for 2014-2016 as proposed by the Nominations and Remuneration Committee and approved by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting on April 8th, 2014 (the Remuneration Policy), defines a structure with a fixed remuneration for all members of the Board of Directors and a variable remuneration, with an annual component and a multi-annual component for the members of the Executive Committee. The Remuneration Policy, including the minor amendments approved by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting held on April 14th 2016, remained unaltered through 2016. On the topic below can be found a reminder of the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) stated in the Remuneration Policy for variable annual and multi-annual variable components.  183  183   ENERGY AS THE NEWART  71. VARIABLE REMUNERATION Variable annual and multi-annual remuneration applies to the members of the Executive Committee. The variable annual remuneration may range from 0 to 68% of the annual fixed remuneration and the multi-annual remuneration from 0 to 120% of the annual fixed remuneration. For Executive Committee Members that are also Officers, there will be a qualitative evaluation of the CEO about the annual performance. This evaluation will have a weight of 20% for the final calculation in the annual variable remuneration and 32% in the multi-annual variable remuneration. The other 80% will be calculated based on the weights indicated in the next paragraph for the annual variable remuneration and 68% for the multi-annual variable. The key performance indicators (KPIs) used to determine the amounts of the annual and multi-annual variable remuneration regarding to each year of the term are aligned with the strategic grounds of the Company: growth, risk control and efficiency. These are the same for all members of the Executive Committee, although with specific targets for the platforms in the case of COOs. For the year 2016 and in order to align the indicators with the company objectives, some minor amendments were applied to some KPIs. The indicators are as follows:  CEO/CFO/Non-Officers Executives Weight Group Platform 2016  Target Group  Key performance Indicator  Growth  Incremental MW (EBITDA+ENEOP)  10%  30%  SelfFunding Strategy  Asset Rotation + Tax Equity  10%  Risk Return  ROIC Cash % TSR vs. Wind peers & PSI 20 EBITDA (in â‚¬) Net Profit (excl.

According to the Remuneration Policy approved by the General Shareholdersâ€™ Meeting, the maximum variable remuneration (annual and multi-annual) is applicable if all the above mentioned KPIâ€™s were achieved and the performance evaluation is equal or above 110%.  72. MULTI-ANNUAL REMUNERATION The Remuneration Policy incorporates the deferral for a period of three years of the multi-annual variable remuneration, being the relevant payment conditioned to the lack of any willful illicit action, known after the appraisal and which endangers the sustainable performance of the company, in line with CMVM corporate governance practices.  73. VARIABLE REMUNERATION BASED ON SHARES EDPR has not allocated variable remuneration on shares and does not maintain Company shares that the Executive Directors have had access to.  184 184   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 EDPR 2016  74.

The primary federal renewable energy incentive program is the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was established by the U.S. Congress as part of 1992 Energy Policy Act. Additionally, many states have passed legislation, principally in the form of renewable portfolio standards (â€œRPSâ€), which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy supply from renewable sources, similar to the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes a number of energy related tax and policy provisions to benefit the development of wind energy generation, namely (i) a three year extension of the PTC until 2012 and (ii) an option to elect a 30% Investment Tax Credit ("ITC") that could replace the PTC through the duration of the extension. This ITC allows the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects placed in service or with the beginning of construction in 2009 and 2010. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment, Insurance and Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was approved and includes an one year extension of the ITC, which allow the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects with beginning of construction until December 2011 as long as placed in service until December 2012. On 1 January 2013, the US Congress approved "The American Taxpayer Relief Act" that includes an extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. Congress set 31 December 2013 as the new expiration date of these benefits and changed the qualification criteria (projects will only qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2013). The legislation also includes a depreciation bonus on new equipment placed in service which allows the depreciation of a higher percentage of the cost of the project (less 50% of the Investment Tax Credit) in the year that it is placed in service. This bonus depreciation was 100% in 2011 and 50% for 2012. On 16 December 2014, the U.S. Congress approved the "Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014" that included an extension of the PTC for wind, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit instead of the PTC. Congress set a new expiration date of 31 December 2014 and kept the qualification criteria (projects can qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2014). On 15 December 2015, the US Congress approved the â€œConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2016â€ that included an extension of the PTC for wind, as well as the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit instead of the PTC. Developers now have until the end of 2016 to start construction of new wind farms to qualify for 10 years of production tax credits at the full level. Congress introduced a phase out for projects that start construction after 2016 and before 2020. These projects will still qualify for production tax credits, but at reduced levels. The levels are 80% for projects starting construction in 2017, 60% in 2018, and 40% in 2019. Developers of projects that start construction before 2020 may elect to claim 30% investment tax credits instead of production tax credits, subject to a similar phase out. The phase out reduces the value of the 30% investment tax credit to 24% in 2017, 18% in 2018, and 12% in 2019. Neither production tax credits nor investment tax credits are allowed for wind projects that start construction in 2020 or later. The aforementioned "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016" also extended the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar projects. Solar projects that are under construction by the end of 2019 will now qualify for the 30% ITC. The credit is reduced to 26% for projects starting construction in 2020 and to 22% for projects starting construction in 2021. The credit drops to a permanent 10% level for projects that begin construction in 2022 or later or that begin construction before 2022, but are placed in service in 2024 or later. Projects must be placed in service by the end of 2023 to qualify for a credit above 10%.  220  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  8   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUALEDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  On 9 February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) announced by the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on 3 August 2015, a rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which is pending judicial review. As of year-end 2016, the judicial review process is ongoing with the DC Circuit Court. Additionally, on 5 May 2016, the US Internal Revenue Service issued guidance that wind farms have 4 years from their start of construction to be placed in service and qualify for the PTC. As a result, projects that start construction prior to year-end 2019 and are placed in service prior to year-end 2023 will be eligible for the PTC. The IRS ruling also includes a provision that allows developers to secure the PTC if 5% of a project's capital components by dollar value are safe harbored in a given year and construction is complete within 4 years. Thus, if a developer safe harbors 5% of project Capex in 2016 for a given project, the project will qualify for 100% PTC if construction is completed by year-end 2020.  Regulatory framework for the activities in Spain On 12 July 2013 the Spanish Council of Ministers approved a comprehensive reform of the energy sector. This energy reform was afterwards implemented by means of a new â€œEnergy Sector Actâ€, a Decree-Law, eight Royal Decrees and three Ministerial Orders. As a part or this Energy Reform, Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 was passed in July 2013. The purpose of this Royal Decree-Law was to adopt a series of measures to ensure the sustainability of the electricity system, affecting mainly the electricity transport, distribution and renewable sectors. Prior to Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, renewable generators benefited from a feed-in tariff regime in which renewable electricity could be sold at a regulated feed-in tariff or at the Spanish wholesale market price plus a variable premium. According to the 2013 regulatory framework, renewable energy facilities are entitled to sell the electricity they generate into the Spanish wholesale market and, during their respective regulatory lives, receive additional payments per installed MW from the Spanish electricity system through the â€œComisiÃ³n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC)â€ body. This regulatory system is intended to allow each standard wind farm to achieve a pre-tax rate of return (fixed at 7,398% until 2019 YE) over its regulatory life. This â€œreasonable returnâ€ was determined by reference to the 10-year Spanish government bond plus a spread of 300 basis points. Regarding the wind sector, Decree Law 413/2014 confirmed that wind farms in operation in 2003 (or before) would not receive any further incentive, while the incentive for the rest of the wind farms would be calculated in order to reach the 7,398% return before taxes. More than 1.300 possible types of renewables installation (â€œstandard facilitiesâ€) are included in the Decree Law, 23 of them corresponding to wind farms of more than 5 MW classified by the year of first operation (from 1994 to 2016). In October 2015 the Government approved Royal Decree 947/2015 and a Ministerial Order aimed at allowing the installation of new renewable capacity through competitive tenders. On January 14th 2016 the first renewable auction was held. The auction was designed to provide a similar remuneration scheme that the one applying to operating facilities (ruled by RD 413/2014). Following this framework, tender participants were requested to bid discounts on the â€œinitial investmentâ€ (CAPEX) parameter which would then, by being plugged in the formula set by RD 413/2014, determine the â€œRinvâ€ (investment premium) that would eventually be awarded. Developers were bidding to build 500 MW of wind energy and 200 MW of biomass plants. The auction was very competitive, around 5 times oversubscribed for onshore wind. EDPR was awarded 93 MW of wind energy. In 2016 the Spanish Government announced it would carry out a new renewables capacity auction in the first months of 2017, after submitting to the CNMC a draft legislation package to articulate the process. Although the auction rules will be in line with the previous ones, there will be some differences. For example, the auction will be technologically neutral, meaning that projects based on different renewable energy technologies, such as wind, solar and biomass, will be able to compete for contracts. The auction will also include control mechanisms and guarantee requirements to ensure the execution and completion of the winning projects. Projects will need to be completed by December 2019, in order to contribute to the fulfillment of the Spanish 2020 target (20% of its energy coming from renewable sources).  Regulatory framework for the activities in Portugal The Portuguese legal provisions applicable to the generation of power from renewable sources are currently established by Decree-Law 189/88 dated 27 May, (subsequently amended by Decree-Law 168/99 dated 18 May, Decree-Law 312/2001 dated 10 December and Decree-Law 339-C/2001 dated 29 December). Also relevant is Decree-Law 33-A/2005, dated 16 February 2005 (â€œDL 33-A/2005â€), which establishes the feed-in tariff remuneration applicable to energy produced by renewable sources. The Portuguese Government published on 28 February 2013, the Decree Law 35/2013 that maintains the legal stability of the current feed-in tariff contracts (following Decree-Law 33-A/2005) and protects the value of the investments made by wind energy producers. However, this Decree Law granted the possibility to adhere to voluntary changes of the existing feed-in tariff. Indeed, wind generators could extend the support scheme (generally 5 or 7 years) in exchange of upfront payments or discounts on existing tariffs. EDPR chose a 7 year extension of the tariff defined as the average market price of previous twelve months, with a floor of 74â‚¬/MWh and a cap of 98â‚¬/MWh (values updated with inflation from 2021 onwards) in exchange for yearly payments from 2013 to 2020.

The additional production generated from the capacity increase would have a fixed remuneration of 60 Euros/MWh, whilst the remaining production would be remunerated at the previous tariff.  Regulatory framework for the activities in France The power sector is governed primarily by Act 2000-108 (amended by Acts 2004-803 and 2006-1537) (â€œAct 2000â€™), passed in February 2000, which regulates the modernization and development of public energy services. Act 2000 allows wind operators to enter into long-term agreements for the sale of their energy with ElectricitÃ© de France (EDF), the national utility. The tariffs were initially set in 2001, then changed in 2006 for new facilities (by Order of July 10). The 2006 tariffs are the following: i) during the first ten years of the PPA, EDF pays a fixed annual tariff, which is â‚¬82 per MWh for applications made during 2006 (tariff is amended annually based, in part, on an inflation-related index); ii) During years 11 to 15 of the PPA, the tariff is based on the annual average percentage of energy produced during the wind facility's first ten years (these tariffs are also amended annually, based, in part, on an inflation-related index); iii) Beginning in the year 16, there is no specific support and wind energy generators will sell their electricity at the market, thus receiving market price. The 2006 feedin tariff was repealed in 2008 due to formal defects in its approval, but was subsequently republished in December 2008 with the same content. On March 2012, the legality of the feed-in tariff ministerial order for wind farm projects was questioned before the French Council of State (Conseil dÃ‰tat) on the basis that the required notification to the European Commission on State Aid has not been done. After years of litigation, the French Council of State decided to cancel the French Wind Tariff on May 2014. Shortly after, the French Government approved and released a new tariff decree ("ArrÃªtÃ© du 17 juin 2014") that had previously received clearance from the European Union. This new decree contains the same parameters than the former one and came into force with retroactive effects. Therefore, it didnÂ´t endanger or modify any power purchase agreement signed under the 2008 Order. In July 2015, the â€œEnergy Transition billâ€, whose aim is to build a long-term and comprehensive energy strategy, was passed. In 66 articles, the text targets to cut France's greenhouse gas emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 (and divide them by four by 2050), to halve the country's energy usage by 2050, to reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production, to cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix. On April 15th 2016, the French council of State published a decision ordering the government to start recovering the interests that the feed-in tariff received from 2008 to 2014 would have generated. This decision was based on the grounds that the French Government failed to notify the European Commission the Ministerial Order approving the Feed-in tariff. A Contract-for-difference (CfD) scheme replacing the feed-in tariff scheme was released in December 2016 for wind farms having requested a PPA in 2016. According to the decree, the strike price would be equal to the value of the current feed-in tariff (similar tenure, indexation and adjustment after year 10), plus a management fee to compensate balancing costs (2,8 â‚¬/MWh). The market reference price will be the production weighted average pool price, using a representative production profile of the wind industry in France. The settlement would be done on a monthly basis. The French Government also disclosed a draft decree for the 2017 CfDs for wind farms below 6 wind turbines. According to the draft, the CfD tenure will be extended to 20 years (instead of 15 years), being the strike price 72â‚¬/MWh (plus the management fee). The draft also includes a limitation of the amount of energy to be remunerated under the CfD strike price. Larger wind farms will be awarded CfDs through competitive tenders. Additionally, on April 24th, 2016 the French Government enacted the so-called â€œProgrammation pluriannuelle des Investissementsâ€ (PPI) which objective is to set different renewablesâ€™ capacity targets by technology, in order to achieve the objectives of the â€œLoi de Transition Ã‰nergÃ©tiqueâ€. The PPI provides short-term (2018) and medium-term (2023) renewablesâ€™ capacity targets and also includes a provisional timetable of the next renewable tenders to be launched between 2017 and 2019.  Regulatory framework for the activities in Poland The legislation applicable to renewable energy in Poland is primarily contained in an Energy Act passed in April 1997, which was subsequently amended by Act 24 July 2002 and the Energy Act of 2 April 2004, which came into effect in January 2005 (together, the â€˜â€˜Energy Actâ€™â€™). The Energy Act introduced a support scheme for renewable energy facilities. The law designed a system of obligatory purchase Green Certificates (GC) by companies selling electricity to end-consumers, with mandatory quotas. These power companies are obliged to: a) obtain GC and submit them to the Energy Regulator, or b) pay a substitution fee calculated in accordance with the Energy Act. If suppliers fail to meet their obligation (either the submission of GC or the payment of substitution fee), they must pay a fine, equal to 130% of the substitution fee in that year. Under the current legislation, the following quota apply (as amended by the ministerial decree of 18 October 2012): 2016: 15.0%, 2017:16.0%, 2018:17.0%, 2019:18.0% , 2020:19.0% and 2021:20.0%. However, the GC scheme was amended in 2015. In February 2015 a new Renewables Law was approved, introducing a different support system for new facilities. According to the law, the current Green Certificate (GC) system would be replaced by a tender scheme granting â€œContracts-for-differenceâ€. The law ensures that the current GC scheme is maintained (with some adjustments) for operating plants. These plants will have, however, the possibility to remain under the existing GC scheme or shift to the new scheme through specific tenders for operating assets.  222  222  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  10   ANNUAL REPORT  ANNUALEDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  In mid-December 2015, as a result of the changes in Parliament (Polandâ€™s general election on 25 October was won by the rightwing Law and Justice Party â€œPiSâ€), the new government postponed the implementation of tenders. On February 19th, 2016 the PiS MPs party proposed a draft law on wind investments covering localization, realizations and operation of wind farms, the so-called â€œWind Turbine Investment Actâ€. After a long approval process in which the renewable sector succeeded in introducing some amendments to the original draft, the law was finally approved. The main measures of this new law include: minimum distance restrictions for new wind farms and increased real estate tax burden. On the other hand, and following the delay of the implementation of RES Act Chapter 4, the government proposed to polish parliament a more comprehensive amendment of the RES Act in early May 2016. These amendments were finally approved and published in late June. While keeping the core of the new auction system, these new amendments brought some modifications (namely introducing technology baskets for future tenders and improving the treatment of biomass, biogas and cofiring technologies). In October 2016 the Polish Government published the Ordinance detailing the amount and value of energy to be auctioned in 2016. Wind energy was not included among the technologies allowed to participate (except for facilities below 1 MW). The auction was held the 30th of December, 2016. On November 23rd, 2016 the Polish government disclosed a draft ordinance detailing the amount and value of energy planned to be auctioned in 2017. The draft highlights that baseload renewables (dedicated biomass and biogas) remain key to the government as they will be allocated around 50% of the total 2017â€™s auction budget. The new draft proposes the budget to be allocated to the pot in which new onshore wind could compete. This amount could amount up to 150 MW. ItÂ´s also likely that wind and PV will compete for the same budget.  Regulatory framework for the activities in Belgium The regulatory framework for electricity in Belgium is conditioned by the division of powers between the federal and the three regional entities: Wallonia, Flanders and Brussels-Capital. The federal regulatory field of competence includes electricity transmission (of transmission levels above 70 kV), generation, tariffs, planning and nuclear energy. The relevant federal legislation is the Electricity Act of 29 April 1999 (as modified) (the â€˜â€˜Electricity Actâ€™â€™). The regional regulatory entities are responsible for distribution, renewable energy and cogeneration (with the exception of offshore power plants) and energy efficiency. The relevant regional legislation, respectively, is: (a) for Flanders, the Electricity Decree of 17 July 2000; (b) for Wallonia, the Regional Electricity Market Decree of 12 April 2001; and (c) for Brussels-Capital, the Order of 19 July 2001 on the Organization of the Electricity Market. The Belgian regulatory system promotes the generation of electricity from renewable sources (and cogeneration) by a system of Green Certificates (GC). Each region has its GC system, although all of them are similar (with differences in quotas, fines and thresholds for granting GCs). In Wallonia, Green Certificates have a minimum price of 65â‚¬ and the penalty for non-compliance is set at 100â‚¬ per missing GC. From 1 January 2015, the number of GC allocated to each technology is calculated according to a new methodology taking following factors into consideration (i) the net amount of electricity produced (ii) the level of CO2 abatement (iii) the economic performance coefficient that varies depending on the technology. The renewableâ€™s quota in Wallonia was fixed at 30,4% in 2016 and will increase to 37,9% in 2020.  Regulatory frameworks for the activities in Romania The promotion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources in Romania was first included in the Electricity Law 318/2003. In 2005 a Green Certificate (GC) mechanism was introduced with mandatory quotas for suppliers, in order to comply with their EU renewable requirements. Since then, the regulatory authority establishes a fixed quota of electricity produced by renewable energy facilities which suppliers are obliged to fulfil. Law 220/2008 of November, introduced some changes in the GC system. In particular, it allowed wind generators to receive 2GC/MWh until 2015. From 2016 onwards generators would receive only 1 GC for each MWh during 15 years. The law also guaranteed that the trading value of GC would have a floor of 27â‚¬ and a cap of 55â‚¬, both indexed to Romanian inflation. Law 220/2008 on renewable energy was amended by the Emergency Order 88/2011. A key aspect of this amendment was the need to perform an â€œovercompensation analysisâ€ on a yearly basis. ANRE (Energy Regulator) was charged to monitor the benefits obtained by renewablesâ€™ producers and annually prepare a report on this regard. If overcompensation is observed, ANRE has to propose a reduction of the applicability period of the support scheme or the number of GCs granted to the technology. This reduction would be then applied only to new facilities. Law 123/2012 of 19 July 2012 on Electricity and Natural Gas eliminated the provision of bilateral contracts not publicly negotiated as a mean to sale electricity. Thus, trading of electricity must be carried out on a centralized market. The Romanian Parliament passed on 17 December 2013, the law for the approval of the Government Emergency Ordinance 57/2013 (the Ordinance), which brought some amendments, being the main ones: - The postponement of GC for operating plants. The postponement only applies to renewable energy operators accredited by ANRE before 2013. Wind power producers would be entitled to receive 2 GCs/MWh until 2017 (inclusive) of which 1 GC is postponed from trading from 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2017. Solar producers have 2 GCs (out of 6 GCs) postponed from trading  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  223 11  223   ENERGY ENERGY AS THE NEWART AS THE NEWART ENERGY AS THE NEWART  from 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2017. The GCs postponed would be gradually recovered until 31 December 2020 (starting on 1 April 2017 for solar PV and 1 January 2018 for wind); - Wind facilities accredited after this date would receive 1.5 GC/MWh until 2017 and 0.75 GC/MWh from 2018 onwards during 15 years. All these GCs were immediately tradable; - Solar facilities would receive 3 GCs from 1 January 2014 onwards. On 24 March 2014, the President of Romania ratified EGO 57/2013 with the following amendments: (i) Reduction of the GC validity from 16 months to 12 months; and (ii) the obligation for ANRE (Energy Regulator) to communicate in each year the GC quota for the next year. The Romanian government approved the draft ordinance setting a quota of 8,3% for 2017. The value approved is in line with the value proposed by ANRE in June 30. In October 2016, the Ministry of Energy published for consultation a draft amendment to the current RES law, aimed at potentially improving GC market oversupply and system sustainability. It includes, among other amendments, an extension of the GC scheme until 2031, a removal of the indexation of the GC parameters and the extension of the GC recovery for wind energy from 2018 to 2025. Regarding PV projects, the draft amendments proposes an extension of the GC postponement until the end of 2024, fixing the recovery from 2025 to 2030  Regulatory frameworks for the activities in Italy On 6 July 2012, the Government approved a new renewable regulation by means of the Decree on Renewables (DM FER) introducing a feed-in-tariff support scheme (therefore, shifting away from the former GC system). The key aspects of this regulation provided by the DM FER were the following: (i) wind farms over 5 MW would be remunerated under a feed-in tariff scheme defined by tenders; (ii) capacity to be tendered to be set by different technologiesâ€™ capacity paths; (iii) the reference tariff for 2013 was 127 â‚¬/MWh for onshore wind and tender participants would bid offering discounts on this reference tariff (in %); (iv) The reference tariff would decrease 2% per year and (v) tariffs would be granted for 20 years. Since the implementation of the tender system, 3 reverse-auction have been held. The latest was hold in 2016 and awarded 869,8 MW of offtake contracts. EDP RenovÃ¡veis SA was awarded 20-year PPAs for six wind farms totaling 127 MW of wind power.  Regulatory frameworks for the activities in Brazil The Electrical Sector in Brazil is regulated by Federal Law nr 8,987 of 13 February 1995, which generally rules the concession and permission regime of public services; Law nr 9,074 of 7 July 1995, which rules the grant and extension of public services concession or permission contracts; Federal Law nr 10,438 of 26 April 2002, which governs the increase in Emergency Electric Power Supply and creates the 3,300 MW Program of Incentives for Alternative Electricity Sources (PROINFA); Federal Law nr 10,762 of 11 November 2003 and Law nr 10,848 of 15 March 2004, concerning commercial rules for the trade of Electric Power; and, subsequent amendments to the legislation. The Decree nr 5,025 of 30 March 2004, regulates the Federal Law nr 10,438 and states the "Alternative Energy Sources" economical and legal framework. PROINFA participants have granted a PPA with ELETROBRÃS, and are subject to the regulator (ANEEL) authority. However, the first stage of PROINFA has ended and the second stage is highly uncertain. After PROINFA program, renewable producers obtain their remuneration by participating in auctions where price is the only criteria. Winners of the auctions obtain a PPA contract at the price bid. Public Electricity Auctions are technically lead by the state â€œEnergy Planning and Research Companyâ€ (EPE), who registers, analyses and allows potential participants. On 13 November 2015, the latest Reserve Auction (A-3) took place. As a result, Brazilian government contracted 1.664 MW of wind (548 MW) and solar PV (1.1 GW) capacity for a 20-year long-term contract through this auction. The auction exclusively sought wind and PV projects, with power delivery start date being 1 November 2018. Wind ceiling price was BRL 213/MWh. EDPR, through its subsidiary EDP RenovÃ¡veis Brasil, S.A., secured in this auction a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement to sell electricity in the regulated market. The energy will be produced by a 140 MW wind farm to be installed in the Brazilian State of Bahia with operations expected for 2018. The initial price of the long term contract was set at R$199.37/MWh, indexed to the Brazilian inflation rate.  224  224  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  12   ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR 2016  02. Accounting policies a) Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting records of EDP RenovÃ¡veis, S.A. and consolidated entities. The consolidated annual accounts for 2016 and 2015 have been prepared to present fairly the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of EDP RenovÃ¡veis, S.A. and subsidiaries at 31 December 2016 and 2015, the consolidated results of operations, consolidated cash flows and changes in consolidated equity for the years then ended. In accordance with Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, from the European Council and Parliament, the Group's consolidated annual accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and its predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and its predecessor bodies. The Board of Directors approved these consolidated annual accounts on 27 February 2017. The annual accounts are presented in thousand Euros, rounded to the nearest thousand. The annual accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the application of fair value basis for derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading and available-for-sale, except those for which a reliable measure of fair value is not available. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the IFRS-EU requires the Board of Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and of the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors considered reasonable in accordance with the circumstances. They form the basis for making judgments regarding the values of the assets and liabilities whose valuation is not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving the highest degree of judgment or complexity, or for which the assumptions and estimates are considered significant, are disclosed in note 3 - Critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies. Accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group companies and in all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and the notes thereto for 2016 include comparative figures for 2015, which formed part of the consolidated annual accounts approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on April 14, 2016.  b) Basis of consolidation Controlled entities Investments in subsidiaries where the Group has control are fully consolidated from the date the Group assumes control over their financial and operating activities until the moment that control ceases to exist. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, independently of the percentage of voting rights held. Joint arrangements The Group classifies an arrangement as a joint arrangement when the jointly control is contractually established. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, independently of the percentage of voting rights held. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that collectively control the arrangement. After determining the existence of joint control, the Group classifies joint arrangements into two types - joint operations and joint ventures. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint operators) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, so the assets and liabilities (and related revenues and expenses) in relation to its interest in the arrangement are recognised and measured in accordance with relevant IFRSs applicable. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint ventures) have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, so this investment shall be included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of joint ventures, included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. When the Groupâ€™s share of losses exceeds its interest in a jointly controlled entity, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of that entity.  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  225 13  225   ENERGY ENERGY AS NEWART ENERGY AS THE THE NEWART AS THE NEWART  Entities over which the Group has significant influence Investments in associates are included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method from the date the Group acquires significant influence to the date it ceases. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its financial and operating policies. The existence of significant influence by the Group is usually evidenced by one or more of the following: - Representation on the Executive Board of Directors or equivalent governing body of the investee; - Participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends and other distributions; - Existence of material transactions between the Group and the investee; - Interchange of managerial personnel; - Provision of essential technical information. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of associates, included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. When the Groupâ€™s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of the associate. Business combination From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable. Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: â€¢  The fair value of the consideration transferred; plus  â€¢  The recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus  â€¢  If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less  â€¢  The net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. Some business combinations in the period have been determined provisionally as the Group is currently in the process of measuring the fair value of the net assets acquired. The identifiable net assets have therefore initially been recognised at their provisional value. Adjustments during the measurement period have been recorded as if they had been known at the date of the combination and comparative information for the prior year has been restated where applicable. Adjustments to provisional values only include information relating to events and circumstances existing at the acquisition date and which, had they been known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. After that period, adjustments to initial measurement are only made to correct an error. Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groupâ€™s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquire. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.  226  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  14   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUALEDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  Accounting for acquisitions of non-controlling interests From 1 January 2010, acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Previously, goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary, which represented the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of the transaction. Investments in foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, are translated to Euro at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve. On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the related exchange differences previously recognised in reserves, are accounted for in the income statement. as part of the profit or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity. Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Inter-company balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities. Common control transactions The accounting for transactions among entities under common control is excluded from IFRS 3. Consequently, in the absence of specific guidance, within IFRSs, the EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group has developed an accounting policy for such transactions, as considered appropriate. According to the Group's policy, business combinations among entities under common control are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the EDP consolidated book values of the acquired company (subgroup). The difference between the carrying amount of the net assets received and the consideration paid, is recognised in equity. Put options related to non-controlling interests EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group records written put options at the date of acquisition of a business combination or at a subsequent date as an advance acquisition of these interests, recording a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, irrespective of the estimated probability that the options will be exercised. The difference between this amount and the amount corresponding to the percentage of the interests held in the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Until 31 December 2009, in years subsequent to initial recognition, the changes in the liability due to the effect of the financial discount are recognised as a financial expense in the consolidated income statement, and the remaining changes are recognised as an adjustment to the cost of the business combination. Where applicable, dividends paid to minority shareholders up to the date the options are exercised are also recorded as adjustments to the cost of the business combination. In the event that the options are not exercised, the transaction would be recorded as a sale of interests to minority shareholders. As from January 2010, the Group applies IAS 27 (2008) to new put options related to non-controlling interests and, therefore, subsequent changes in the carrying amount of the put liability are recognised in profit or loss. Business combinations achieved in stages In a business combination achieved in stages, the excess of the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred, (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquiree (iii) the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business; over the net of amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill. If applicable, the defect, after evaluating the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquiree, the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business; and the valuation of the net assets acquired, is recognized in the income statement. The Group recognizes the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business and the carrying value in consolidated results according to its classification. Additionally, the Group reclassifies the deferred amounts in other comprehensive income relating to the previously held equity interest to the income statement or consolidated reserves, according to their nature.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. These exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities accounted for at historical cost are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities stated at fair value are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the dates the fair value was determined.  d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trade date at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value of derivative financial instruments is re-measured on a regular basis, being the gains or losses on re-measurement recognised directly in the income statement, except for derivatives designated as hedging instruments. The recognition of the resulting gains or losses on re-measurement of the derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the risk being hedged and of the hedge model used. The fair value of derivative financial instruments corresponds to their market value, if available, or to quotes indicated by external entities through the use of valuation techniques, which are compared in each date of report to fair values available in common financial information platforms.  Hedge accounting The Group uses financial instruments to hedge interest and foreign exchange risks resulting from its operational and financing activities. The derivate financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded as for trading. The derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, being the gains and losses recognised in accordance with the hedge accounting model adopted by the Group. Hedge accounting is used when: (i) At the inception of the hedge, the hedge relationship is identified and documented; (ii) The hedge is expected to be highly effective; (iii) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; (iv) The hedge is revalued on an on-going basis and is considered to be highly effective over the reporting period; and (v) The forecast transactions hedged are highly probable and represent a risk to changes in cash flows that could affect the income statement. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge model is recognised in equity. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship are recognised in the income statement in the moment they occur. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in equity are also reclassified to the income statement over the periods in which the hedged item will affect the income statement. When the forecast transaction hedge results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains or losses recorded in equity are included in the acquisition cost of the asset. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity at that time stays recognised in equity until the hedged transaction also affects the income statement. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses recognized in equity are recorded in the income statement. Net investment hedge The net investment hedge is applied on a consolidated basis to investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies. The exchange differences recorded against exchange differences arising on consolidation are offset by the exchange differences arising from the foreign currency borrowings used for the acquisition of those subsidiaries. If the hedging instrument is a derivative, the gains or losses arising from fair value changes are also recorded against exchange differences arising on consolidation. The ineffective portion of the hedging relation is recognised in the income statement.  228  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  16   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL EDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  e) Other financial assets The Group classifies its other financial assets at acquisition date in the following categories: Loans and receivable Loans and receivable are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently are measured at amortised cost less impairment losses. Impairment losses are recorded based on the valuation of estimated losses from non-collection of loans and receivable at the balance sheet date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, and can be reversed if the estimated losses decrease in a later period. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category includes: (i) financial assets held for trading, which are those acquired for the purpose of being traded in the short term, and (ii) financial assets that are designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale and that are not classified in any of the other categories. The Groupâ€™s investments in equity securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition Purchases and sales of: (i) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and (ii) available-for-sale investments, are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, in which case these transaction costs are directly recognised in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when: (i) the contractual rights to receive their cash flows have expired, (ii) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership or (iii) although retaining some, but not substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, the Group has transferred the control over the assets. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Available-for-sale financial assets are also subsequently carried at fair value. However, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the financial assets are derecognised or impaired. When this occurs, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity are immediately recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange differences arising from equity investments classified as available-for-sale are also recognised in equity. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method and dividends, are recognised in the income statement. The fair values on quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. For unlisted securities the Group determines the fair value through: (i) valuation techniques, including the use of recent armâ€™s length transactions or discounted cash flow analysis and (ii) valuation assumptions based on market information. Financial instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost. Reclassifications between categories The Group does not reclassify, after initial recognition, a financial instrument into or out of the fair value through profit or loss category. Impairment At each balance sheet date, an assessment is performed as to whether there is objective evidence of impairment, including any impairment resulting in an adverse effect on estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the recoverable amount of the financial asset is determined, and the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after their initial recognition, such as: (i) in the case of listed securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the listed price of the security, and (ii) in the case of unlisted securities, when that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated amount of the future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated. Evaluating the existence of objective evidence of impairment involves judgement, in which case the Group considers, among other factors, price volatility and current economic situation. Thus, when listed securities are concerned, it is considered as continuous a devaluation in the listed price of the security for a period over 24 months and as significant a devaluation of the security's value above 40%.  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  229 17   ENERGY ENERGY ENERGY AS THE THE NEWART AS NEWART AS THE NEWART  If there is objective evidence of impairment on available-for-sale investments, the cumulative potential loss recognised in fair values reserves, corresponding to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value at the balance sheet date, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred to the income statement.  f) Financial liabilities An instrument is classified as a financial liability when it contains a contractual obligation to transfer cash or another financial asset, independently from its legal form. These financial liabilities are recognised (i) initially at fair value less transaction costs and (ii) subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. The Group derecognises the whole or part of a financial liability when the obligations included in the contract have been satisfied or the Group is legally released of the fundamental obligation related to this liability either through a legal process or by the creditor.  g) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. To the extent that funds are borrowed generally, the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation are determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on these assets. The capitalisation rate corresponds to the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the enterprise that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during a period does not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during the period. The capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when expenditures for the asset are being incurred, borrowing costs have been incurred and activities necessary to prepare all or part of the assets for their intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use or sale are completed. Capitalisation of borrowing costs shall be suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted.  h) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. In case of projects in a development stage, costs are only capitalized when it is probable that the project will be finally built. If due to changes in regulation or other circumstances costs capitalized are derecognized from property plant and equipment, they are recognized in the profit and loss caption of â€œOther expensesâ€. Replacements or renewals of complete items are recognized as increases in the value of property, plant and equipment and the items replaced or renewed are derecognized and recognized in the â€œOther expensesâ€ caption. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. The cost of acquisition includes interest on external financing and personnel costs and other internal expenses directly or indirectly related to work in progress accrued solely during the period of construction. The cost of production is capitalised by charging costs attributable to the asset as own work capitalised under financial expenses and personnel costs and employee benefit expense in the consolidated income statement. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent costs are recognised as separate assets only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. All repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. The Group assesses assets impairment, whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the impairment being recognised in the income statement.  230  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  18   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUALEDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on the other assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Number of years  Buildings and other constructions Plant and machinery: - Renewable assets - Other plant and machinery Transport equipment Office equipment and tools Other tangible fixed assets  8 to 40 30 4 to 12 3 to 5 2 to 10 3 to 10  At the end of December 2016, EDPR Group has changed the useful life of the renewable assets from 25 to 30 years (see note 3).  i) Intangible assets The GroupÂ´s intangible assets are booked at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group does not own intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Group performs impairment tests, whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. Acquisition and development of software Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives. Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable specific software applications by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include employee costs directly associated with the development of the referred software and are amortised using the straight-line method during their expected useful lives. Maintenance costs of software are charged to the income statement when incurred. Industrial property and other rights The amortisation of industrial property and other rights is calculated using the straight-line method for an expected useful live expected of less than 6 years. Green Certificates As per Romanian Regulatory Framework, there's a category of Green Certificates (GCs) which although granted are restricted for sale until 2017 (solar) and 2018 (wind). These deferred GCs are recognised as intangible assets when generated at fair market value. These GCs will be offset as they will be collected. Power purchase agreements Acquired Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are booked as intangible assets and amortised using the straight-line method according with the duration of the contract.  j) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or groups of non-current assets held for sale (groups of assets and related liabilities that include at least one noncurrent asset) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered mainly through sale, the assets or groups of assets are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The Group also classifies as non-current assets held for sale, non-current assets or groups of assets acquired exclusively for its subsequent resale, that are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The measurement of all non-current assets and all assets and liabilities included in a disposal group, is adjusted in accordance with the applicable IFRS standards, immediately before their classification as held for sale. Subsequently, these assets or disposal groups are measured at the lowest between their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  k) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is then estimated. For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the cash-generating unit). The goodwill  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  231 19   ENERGY AS THE NEWART ENERGY AS THE NEWART  acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in circumstances that caused the impairment. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.  l) Leases The Group classifies its lease agreements as finance leases or operating leases taking into consideration the substance of the transaction rather than its legal form. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating leases Lease payments are recognised as an expense and charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.  m) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of the acquisition cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes purchases, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated selling costs. The cost of inventories is assigned by using the weighted average method.  n) Classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current The Group classifies assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as current and non-current. Current assets and liabilities are determined as follows: Assets are classified as current when they are expected to be realised or are intended for sale or consumption in the Groupâ€™s normal operating cycle, they are held primarily for the purpose of trading, they are expected to be realised within twelve months of the balance sheet date or are cash or a cash equivalent, unless the assets may not be exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities are classified as current when they are expected to be settled in the Groupâ€™s normal operating cycle, they are held primarily for the purpose of trading, they are due to be settled within twelve months of the balance sheet date or the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Financial liabilities are classified as current when they are due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, even if the original term was for a period longer than twelve months, and an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the reporting period and before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue.  o) Provisions Provisions are recognised when: (i) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, (ii) it is probable that settlement will be required in the future and (iii) a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Dismantling and decommissioning provisions The Group recognises dismantling and decommissioning provisions for property, plant and equipment when a legal or contractual obligation is settled to dismantling and decommissioning those assets at the end of their useful life. Consequently, the Group has booked provisions for property, plant and equipment related with renewables assets, for the expected cost of restoring sites and land to its original condition. The provisions correspond to the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation and are recognised as part of the initial cost or an adjustment to the cost of the respective asset, being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the asset useful life.  232  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  20   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL EDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  The assumptions used for 2016 are: Europe  North America  South America  25,873 33,954  26,715 -  28,954 29,915  35,603 19,787  33,942 -  [0.00% - 1.77%] [1.51% - 3.57%] [0.65% - 3.87%] -  Average cost per MW (Euros) Wind (Steel structure) Wind (Concrete structure) Salvage value per MW (Euros) Wind (Steel structure) Wind (Concrete structure) Discount rate Euro PLN USD CAD RON BRL Inflation rate Euro zone Poland Romania USA Canada Brazil Capitalisation (number of years)  [0.72% - 2.94%] [0.72% - 2.94%] [2.00% - 2.30%] [2.00% - 2.30%] 30  46,338 17,421 [11.91% - 12.47%] [4.20% - 5.64%] 30  [1.01% - 2.35%] [1.45% - 2.40%] [2.30% - 2.70%] 30  The assumptions used for 2015 were: Europe  North America  South America  14,000 14,000  21,618 -  16,304 16,304  41,000 41,000  29,724 -  30,305 30,305  [1.90% - 2.50%] [3.00% - 4.00%] [4.50% - 5.65%] -  [3.85% - 5.00%] [3.35% - 4.25%] -  12.75%  [1.75% - 1.85%] 0.90% [1.75% - 1.85%] 25  Average cost per MW (Euros) Wind (Steel structure) Wind (Concrete structure) Salvage value per MW (Euros) Wind (Steel structure) Wind (Concrete structure) Discount rate Euro PLN USD CAD RON BRL Inflation rate Euro zone Poland Romania USA Canada Brazil Capitalisation (number of years)  2.50% 2.25% 25  5.4% 25  Due to the change of the useful life of the renewable assets from 25 to 30 years (see note 2 h and 3) the capitalisation rate (number of years) of the dismantling and decommissioning provisions has changed to 30 years with effects December 2016. Decommissioning and dismantling provisions are remeasured on an annual basis based on the best estimate of the settlement amount. In this sense, EDPRâ€™s technical department performed an in-depth analysis taking into account the reality of the EDPRâ€™s fleet. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the average cost per megawatt and salvage value of the renewables assets have required to be updated, according to the values disclosed above, with effects December 2016. The unwinding of the discount at each balance sheet date is charged to the income statement. Tax liabilities Liabilities for payment of taxes or levies related to an activity of the Group are recognized as the activity which triggers the payment is carried out, according to the laws regulating such taxes or levies. However, in the cases of taxes or levies with right of reimbursement of the amount already paid proportionally to the period of time in which there is no activity or the asset which triggers the payment is no longer owned, liabilities are recognized on a proportional basis.  p) Recognition of costs and revenue Costs and revenues are recorded in the year to which they refer regardless of when paid or received, in accordance with the accrual concept. Differences between amounts received and paid and the corresponding revenue and expenditure are recorded under other assets and other liabilities. Revenue comprises the amounts invoiced on the sale of products or of services rendered, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts, after elimination of intra-group sales. Revenue from energy sales is recognised in the period that energy is generated and transferred to customers. Deferred Green Certificates (GCs) are recognised as revenue at fair market value.

Interest income is recognised in the income statement based on the effective interest rate method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity's right to receive payments is established.  r) Income tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a items recognized directly in equity, in which case is also recognized in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.  s) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding the average number of ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury stock.  t) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include balances with maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition, including cash and deposits in banks. This caption also includes other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and specific demand deposits in relation to institutional partnerships that are funds required to be held in escrow sufficient to pay the remaining construction related costs of projects in institutional equity partnerships in U.S.A., in the next twelve months. The Group classifies as cash and cash equivalents the balance of the current accounts with the Group formalized under cashpooling agreements.  u) Government grants Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income under non-current liabilities when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised.  v) Environmental issues The Group takes measures to prevent, reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its activities. Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as other operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred.  w) Institutional partnerships in U.S. wind farms The Group has entered in several partnerships with institutional investors in the United States, through limited liability Company operating agreements that apportion the cash flows generated by the wind farms between the investors and the Company and allocates the tax benefits, which include Production Tax Credits (PTCs), Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and accelerated depreciation, largely to the investor.  234  234  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  22   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUALEDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  The institutional investors purchase their minority partnership interests for an upfront cash payment with an agreed targeted internal rate of return over the period that the tax credits are generated. This anticipated return is computed based on the total anticipated benefit that the institutional investors will receive and includes the value of PTCâ€™s / ITC's, allocated taxable income or loss and cash distributions received. The control and management of these wind farms are a responsibility of EDPR Group and they are fully consolidated in these financial statements. The upfront cash payment received is recognised under â€˜Liabilities arising from institutional partnershipsâ€™ and subsequently measured at amortised cost. This liability is reduced by the value of tax benefits provided and cash distributions made to the institutional investors during the contracted period. The value of the tax benefits delivered, primarily accelerated depreciation and ITC are recognized as Income from institutional partnerships on a pro-rata basis over the 25 year useful life of the underlying projects (see note 7). The value of the PTC's delivered are recorded as generated. This liability is increased by an interest accrual that is based on the outstanding liability balance and the targeted internal rate of return agreed. After the Flip Date, the institutional investor retains a non-significant interest for the duration of the structure. This noncontrolling interest is entitled to distributions ranging from 2.5 % to 6 % and taxable income allocations ranging from 5% to 17%. EDPR NA has an option to purchase the institutional investorâ€™s residual interest at fair market value during a defined period following the flip date. A liability to provide for the institutional investorsâ€™ minority interest is accreted on a straight-line basis from the funding date through the Flip Date.  03. Critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies The IFRS set forth a range of accounting treatments and require the Board of Directors to apply judgment and make estimates in deciding which treatment is most appropriate. The main accounting estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies are discussed in this note in order to improve the understanding of how their application affects the Groupâ€™s reported results and disclosures. A broader description of the accounting policies employed by the Group is disclosed in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although estimates are calculated by the Board of Directors based on the best information available at 31 December 2016 and 2015, future events may require changes to these estimates in subsequent years. Any effect on the financial statements of adjustments to be made in subsequent years would be recognised prospectively. Considering that in many cases there are alternatives to the accounting treatment adopted by EDP RenovÃ¡veis, the Groupâ€™s reported results could differ if a different treatment was chosen. EDP RenovÃ¡veis believes that the choices made are appropriate and that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, the Groupâ€™s financial position and results. The alternative outcomes discussed below are presented solely to assist the reader in understanding the financial statements and are not intended to suggest that other alternatives or estimates would be more appropriate. Fair value of derivatives Fair values are based on listed market prices, if available, otherwise fair value is determined either by dealer prices (both for that transaction or for similar instruments traded) or by pricing models, based on net present value of estimated future cash flows which take into account market conditions for the underlying instruments, time value, yield curves and volatility factors. These pricing models may require assumptions or judgments in estimating fair values. Consequently, the use of a different model or of different assumptions or judgments in applying a particular model may have produced different financial results for a particular period. Fair value measurement of contingent consideration The contingent consideration, from a business combination or a sale of a minority interest while retaining control is measured at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business combination or at the date of the sale in the event of a sale of a minority interest. The contingent consideration is subsequently remeasured at fair value at balance sheet date. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The main assumptions consider the probability of achieving each objective and the discount factor, corresponding to the best estimates of management at each balance sheet date. Changes in assumptions could have impact on the values of contingent assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Review of the useful life of assets related to production According to IAS 8, estimates must be revised when new information becomes available which indicates a change in circumstances upon which the estimates were formed. It is observable that an extension in the useful life of renewable assets is the industry trend. During 2016, in the light of this fact, EDPR management has decided to conduct an in depth review of the useful lifetime of its renewable assets to determine what is the most appropriate depreciation lifetime to consider in its local and IFRS financial statements. The analysis performed covers technical (through internal and third party technical analysis), financial, economic and other considerations such as contractual or regulatory constraints. Based on these results, at the end of December 2016, EDPR has approved to revise the current estimate extending the useful life of its renewable assets up to 30 years, consequently, leading to a prospective change in the depreciation charge. Although useful life may have some level of  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  235 23  235   ENERGY ENERGY AS THE NEWART AS THE NEWART  discrete asset variation depending on the specific site specificities, it is judged reasonable and accurate to use the standard of 30 years for the entire fleet. Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment test are performed whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets is less than the corresponding net book value of assets. On an annual basis, the Group reviews the assumptions used to assess the existence of impairment in goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shares in subsidiaries. The assumptions used are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic indicators and business assumptions used by management. The net interest in associates is reviewed when circumstances indicate the existence of impairment. Considering that estimated recoverable amounts related to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are based on the best information available, changes in the estimates and judgments could change the impairment test results which could affects the Groupâ€™s reported results. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant interpretations and estimates are required in determining the global amount for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Different interpretations and estimates would result in a different level of income taxes, current and deferred, recognised in the period. Tax Authorities are entitled to review EDP RenovÃ¡veis, and its subsidiariesâ€™ determination of its annual taxable earnings, for a determined period that may be extended in case there are tax losses carried forward. Therefore, it is possible that some additional taxes may be assessed, mainly as a result of differences in interpretation of the tax law. However, the EDP RenovÃ¡veis and its subsidiaries, do not anticipate any significant changes to the income tax booked in the financial statements. Dismantling and decommissioning provisions The Board of Directors considers that Group has contractual obligations with the dismantling and decommissioning of property, plant and equipment related to wind electricity generation. For these responsibilities the Group has recorded provisions for the expected cost of restoring sites and land to its original condition. The provisions correspond to the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. EDPRâ€™s technical department performed an in-depth analysis taking into account the reality of the EDPRâ€™s fleet. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the average cost per megawatt and salvage value of the renewables assets requires to be updated, with effects December 2016 (see note 2 o). Additionally, due to the change of the useful life of the renewable assets from 25 to 30 years (see note 2 h) the capitalisation rate (number of years) of the dismantling and decommissioning provisions has changed to 30 years with effects December 2016. The use of different assumptions in estimates and judgments referred may have produced different results from those that have been considered. Green Certificates As a consequence of the regulatory framework in Romania related to Green Certificates (GCs), the Group has the following assumptions: (i) For estimating the price of GCs, the model is based on current regulation including the latest developments published in the last months and estimations on renewable capacity to be added in the following years; (ii) The GC model determines whether there will be excess or deficit of GCs to evaluate the price to apply; "In order to determine whether there will be excess or deficit of GCs, we compare demand with supply of GCs. Demand of GCs is calculated by multiplying gross electricity consumption and quotas of renewable electricity. Electricity demand growth is based in latest external estimates, including those from Romanian regulator ANRE. EDPR has made sensitivity analyses to the quotas and has assumed a conservative scenario that considers the latest regulatory changes. Entities included in the consolidation perimeter In order to determine which entities must be included in the consolidation perimeter, the Group evaluates whether it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. This evaluation requires judgement, assumptions and estimates in order to conclude whether the Group is in fact exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Other assumptions and estimates could lead to a different consolidation perimeter of the Group, with direct impact in the consolidated financial statements.  236  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  24   ANNUAL REPORT  ANNUAL EDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  04. Financial risk management policies The businesses of EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in market prices, foreign exchange and interest rates. Main financial risks arise from interest-rate and the exchange-rate exposures. The unpredictability of the financial markets is analysed on an on-going basis in accordance with EDPRâ€™s risk management policy. Financial instruments are used to minimize potential adverse effects resulting from interest rates and foreign exchange rates risks on EDP RenovÃ¡veis financial performance. The Board of Directors of EDP RenovÃ¡veis is responsible for the definition of general risk-management principles and the establishment of exposure limits. Recommendations to manage financial risks of EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group are proposed by EDPR's Finance and Global Risk Departments and discussed in the Financial Risk Committee of EDP RenovÃ¡veis, which is held quarterly. The pre-agreed strategy is shared with the Finance Department of EDP - Energias de Portugal, S.A., to verify the accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors of EDP. The evaluation of appropriate hedging mechanisms and the execution are outsourced to the Finance Department of EDP. All transactions undertaken using derivative financial instruments require the prior approval of the Board of Directors, which defines the parameters of each transaction and approves the formal documents describing their objectives. Exchange-rate risk management EDPR/EDP Groupâ€™s Financial Department are responsible for managing the foreign exchange exposure of the Group, seeking to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets and net profits of the Group, using foreign exchange derivatives, foreign exchange debt and/or other hedging structures with symmetrical exposure characteristics to those of the hedged item. The effectiveness of these hedges is reassessed and monitored throughout their lives. EDPR operates internationally and is exposed to the exchange-rate risk resulting from investments in foreign subsidiaries. With the objective of minimizing the impact of exchange rates fluctuations, EDP RenovÃ¡veis general policy is to fund each project in the currency of the operating cash flows generated by the project. Currently, the main currency exposure is the U.S. Dollar, resulting from the shareholding in EDPR NA. With the increasing capacity in other geographies, EDPR is also becoming exposed to other currencies (Brazilian Real, Zloty, New Romanian Leu, British Pound and Canadian Dollar). To hedge the risk originated with net investment in EDPR NA, EDP RenovÃ¡veis entered into a CIRS in USD/EUR with EDP Branch and also uses financial debt expressed in USD. Following the same strategy adopted to hedge these investments in USA, EDP RenovÃ¡veis has also entered into CIRS in BRL/EUR and in PLN/EUR to hedge the investments in Brazil and Poland (see note 35). Sensitivity analysis - Foreign exchange rate As a consequence a depreciation/appreciation of 10% in the foreign currency exchange rate, with reference to 31 December 2016 and 2015, would originate an increase/(decrease) in EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group income statement and equity before taxes, as follows: Thousand Euros  31 Dec 2016 Equity  Profit or loss +10% USD / EUR  -10%  10,822 10,822  -13,227 -13,227  +10%  -10%  -  -  31 Dec 2015 Profit or loss  Equity  +10%  -10%  -359 -359  439 439  USD / EUR  +10% -  -10% -  This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely interest rates, remain unchanged. Interest rate risk management The Groupâ€™s operating cash flows are substantially independent from the fluctuation in interest-rate markets. The purpose of the interest-rate risk management strategy is to reduce the exposure of debt cash flows to market fluctuations. As such, whenever considered necessary and in accordance to the Group's policy, interest-rate financial instruments are contracted to hedge interest rate risks. These financial instruments hedge cash flows associated with future interest payments, converting floating rate loans into fixed rate loans.

The EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group has a portfolio of interest-rate derivatives with maturities up to 10 years. The Financial Department of EDP Group undertakes sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest-rate fluctuations or upcoming cash flows. financial instruments. Sensitivity analysis - Interest rates by the Group, contracting derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk. Based on the EDPR Group debt portfolio and the related derivative financial instruments used to hedge associated interest rate risk, as well as on the shareholder loans received by EDP RenovÃ¡veis, a change of 50 basis points in the interest rates with before taxes, as follows: 31 Dec 2016 Equity  Thousand Euros Profit or loss - 50 BPS Cash flow hedge derivatives Unhedged debt (variable interest rates)  - 50 BPS  -  -  8,334  -8,668  -1,119  1,119  -  -  1,119  8,334  31 Dec 2015 Equity  Thousand Euros Profit or loss - 50 BPS Cash flow hedge derivatives Unhedged debt (variable interest rates)  - 50 BPS  -  -  15,668  -16,388  -594  594  -  -  594  15,668  This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely foreign exchange rates, remain unchanged. Counter-party credit-rate risk management in financial transactions The EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group counter-party risk exposure in financial and non-financial transactions is managed by an analysis of technical capacity, competitiveness and probability of default to the counter-party. EDP RenovÃ¡veis has defined a counter-party risk policy inspired in Basel III, which is implemented across all departments in all EDP RenovÃ¡veis geographies. EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group is exposed to counter-party risk in financial derivatives transactions and in energy sales (electricity, GC and RECs). Counterparties in derivatives and financial transactions are restricted to high-quality credit institutions or to the EDP Group. Most relevant counterparties in derivatives and financial transactions are companies within EDP Group. Financial instruments contracted outside EDP Group are generally engaged under ISDA Master Agreements and credit quality of external counterparties is analysed and collaterals required when needed. In the process of selling the energy (electricity, GCs and RECs produced), exposure arise from trade receivables, but also from mark-to-market of long term contracts: â€¢  â€¢  in the energy market of their respective countries (OMIE and MEFF in the case of the Spanish market). Credit risk from trade receivables is not significant due to the limited average collection period for customer balances and the quality of its debtors. Additional counter-party risk comes from the countries with renewables incentives, which it is usually treated as regulatory risk. market agents in the US. As it occurs in Europe, credit risk from trade receivables is not significant due to the limited mark-to-market of long term contracts may be significant. This exposure is managed by a detailed assessment of the counter-party before signing any long term agreement and by a requirement of collaterals when needed.  Regarding Trade receivables and Other debtors, net of the impairment losses recognised. The Group believes that the credit quality of these receivables is adequate and that no significant impaired credits exist that have not been recognised as such and provided for.  238  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  2   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL EDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  The maximum exposure to customer credit risk by counterparty type is detailed as follows: Thousand Euros  Dec 2016  Dec 2015  35,289 2,395 37,684  51,131 8,308 59,439  Corporate sectors and individuals Supply companies Business to business Business to consumers Other Total Corporate sectors and individuals Public sector  51,644  28,926  Total Public sector and Corporate sectors/individuals  89,328  88,365  Trade receivables by geographical market for the Group EDPR, is as follows: Thousand Euros Europe  Brazil  Dec 2016 Total  30,772 40,675 71,447  3,223 6,833 10,056  3,689 4,136 7,825  37,684 51,644 89,328  Europe  Corporate sectors and individuals Public sector Total  North America  North America  Brazil  Dec 2015 Total  Thousand Euros Corporate sectors and individuals Public sector Total  55,904 25,902 81,806  1,262 2,978 4,240  2,273 46 2,319  59,439 28,926 88,365  Regarding to past-due and not impaired Trade receivables, is analysed as follow: Thousand Euros  Dec 2016  Dec 2015  3,943 3,033  18,535 3,188  -  -1,342  82,352  67,984  89,328  88,365  Past due but not impaired trade receivables: Less than 3 months More than 3 months Impaired trade receivables Not past due and not impaired trade receivables Total  The age of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired may vary significantly depending on the type of customer (corporate sector and individuals or public sector). EDPR Group recognises impairment losses based on an economic case by case analysis, according with the characteristics of the customers. Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk is the possibility that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group strategy to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have significant liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. The liquidity policy followed ensures compliance with payment obligations acquired, through maintaining sufficient credit facilities and having access to the EDP Group facilities. The EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group undertakes management of liquidity risk through the engagement and maintenance of credit lines and financing facilities with its main shareholder, as well as directly in the market with national and international financial institutions, assuring the necessary funds to perform its activities.  Market price risk As at 31 December 2016, market price risk affecting the EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group is not significant. In the case of EDPR NA, the great majority of the plants are under power purchase agreements, with fixed or escalating prices. In the case of EDPR EU, the electricity is sold in Spain, France, Italy and Portugal through regulated tariffs whether in Romania and Poland most plants sell their electricity and green certificates under power purchase agreements with fixed prices or floors. For the small share of energy sold with merchant exposure (electricity, green certificates and RECs generated, this market risk is managed through electricity sales swaps and REC swaps. EDPR EU and EDPR NA have electricity sales and REC swaps that qualify for hedge accounting (cash flow hedge) that are related to electricity sales for the years 2017 to 2020 (see note 35). The purpose of EDP RenovÃ¡veis Group is to hedge a volume of energy generated to reduce its exposure to the energy price volatility.

In conformity with other sector groups, the Group controls its financing structure based on the leverage ratio.

Nevertheless, the company and the majority of its Spanish subsidiaries in Spain are taxed under the tax consolidation group regime applicable according to the Spanish law. EDP - Energias de Portugal, S.A. - Sucursal en EspaÃ±a (Branch) is the dominant company of this Group which includes other subsidiaries that are not within the renewables energy industry. As per the applicable tax legislation, tax periods may be subject to examination by the various Tax Administrations during a limited number of years. Statutes of limitation differ from country to country, as follows: USA, Belgium and France: 3 years; Spain, United Kingdom, Italy and Portugal: 4 years or, in the case of Portugal, if tax losses/credits have been used, the number of years that such tax losses/credits may be carry forward; Brazil, Romania, Poland, Italy and Mexico: 5 years; and Canada: 10 years. Tax losses generated in each year are also subject to Tax Administrationsâ€™ review and reassessment. Losses may be used to offset yearly taxable income assessed in the subsequent periods, as follows: 5 years in Poland; 7 in Romania; 10 in Mexico; 12 in Portugal (which is reduced to 5 years from 2017 onwards); 20 in the USA and Canada; and indefinitely in Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Brazil and the United Kingdom. Moreover, in the United Kingdom and France tax losses in a given year may be carried back against the taxable base assessed in the previous tax year and in the USA and Canada in the 2 and 3 previous years, respectively. However, the deduction of tax losses in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, France, Italy and Poland may be limited to a percentage of the taxable income of each period. EDP Renewables Group companies may, in accordance with the law, benefit from certain tax benefits or incentives in specific conditions, namely the Production Tax Credits in the US which are the dominant form of wind remuneration in that country, and represent an extra source of revenue per unit of electricity ($23/MWh in 2016 and 2015), over the first 10 years of the assetâ€™s life. EDP Renewables Group transfer pricing policy follows the rules, guidelines and best international practices applicable across all geographies where the Group operates, in due compliance with the spirit and letter of the Law.  250  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  38   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT 2016 ANNUALEDPREDPR 2016 REPORT EDPR 2016  Changes in thein the tax lawrelevance to theto theRenewables Group in 2016 2016 Changes tax law with with relevance EDP EDP Renewables Group in Corporate income tax (â€œCITâ€) rate rate Corporate income tax (â€œCITâ€) -  The statutory CIT rate applicable in Spain (in particular, in the in the so called â€œCommon Territoryâ€) was reduced28% to The statutory CIT rate applicable in Spain (in particular, so called â€œCommon Territoryâ€) was reduced from from 28% to 25%, with effect from 1from 1 January onwards, according to Lawto Law 27/2014, November 2014. 2014. 25%, with effect January 2016 2016 onwards, according 27/2014, of 27 of 27 November  -  In 2016 the statutory CIT rates (IRES)(IRES) applicable in in Italy, FranceFrance and the United Kingdomreduced as In 2016 the statutory CIT rates applicable in 2017 2017 in Italy, and the United Kingdom were were reduced as follows: follows: â€¢ In Italy, from 27.5%27.5% to effective from 1from 1 January onwards, as per as per the Budget Law; Law; â€¢ In Italy, from to 24%, 24%, effective January 2017 2017 onwards, the 2016 2016 Budget â€¢ In France, the Government announced in 2016 that the CIT rate would would be progressively lowered from 33.33% â€¢ In France, the Government announced in 2016 that the CIT rate be progressively lowered down down from 33.33% to 28% for all for all companies before 2020, starting in with small and medium-sized enterprises and expanding to to 28% companies before 2020, starting in 2017 2017 with small and medium-sized enterprises and expanding to larger larger companies as a second step; companies as a second step; â€¢ In the In the United Kingdom, at Summer Budget the government announced legislation setting the CIT main rate rate â€¢ United Kingdom, at Summer Budget 2015 2015 the government announced legislation setting the CIT main (for all(for all profits except ring profits) at 19% for thefor the starting 1 April12017 and atand atfor thefor the starting profits except ring fence fence profits) at 19% years years starting April 2017 18% 18% years years starting 1 April12020. 2020.

The goodwill of the EDPR Group is tested for impairment each year with basis of September. In the case of operational wind farms, it is performed by determining the recoverable value through the value in use. Goodwill is allocated to each country calculate the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated. To perform this analysis, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method was used. This method is based on the principle that the estimated value of an entity or business is defined by its capacity to generate financial resources in the future, assuming these of the activity. business, discounted at appropriate discount rates. The future cash flows projection period used is the useful life of the assets (30 years) which is consistent with the current depreciation method. The cash flows also incorporate the long-term off-take contract in place and long-term estimates of power prices, whenever the asset holds merchant exposure. The main assumptions used for the impairment tests are as follows: long-term predictability of wind output and that wind generation is supported in nearly all countries by regulatory mechanisms  not available, prices were derived using price curves projected by the company based on its experience, internal models and - New capacity: tests were based on the best information available on the wind farms expected to be built in coming years, adjusted by probability of success and by the growth prospects of the company based on the Business Plan Targets, its historical growth and market size projections.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Fair value of financial instruments is based, whenever available, on quoted market prices. Otherwise, fair value is determined through internal models, which are based on generally accepted cash flow discounting techniques and option valuation models or through quotations supplied by third parties. Non-standard instruments may require alternative techniques, which consider their characteristics and the generally accepted market practices applicable to such instruments. These models are developed considering the market variables that affect the underlying instrument, namely yield curves, exchange rates and volatility factors.  As at 31 December 2016 and 2015, the following table presents the interest rate curves of the major currencies to which the Group is exposed. These interest rates were used as the base for the fair value calculations made through internal models referred above:  3 months 6 months 9 months 1 year 2 years 3 years 5 years 7 years 10 years  -  EUR  31 Dec 2016 Currencies  . . . . . . . . .

Relevant and subsequent events EDPR announces the sale of a minority stake in Portuguese assets to CTG EDPR through its subsidiary EDP Renewables Europe, S.L. (â€œEDPR Europeâ€), entered in February 2017 into an agreement with ACE Portugal SÃ rl which is 100% owned by ACE Investment Fund II LP â€“ an entity participated of China Three Gorges Hong Kong Ltd (â€œCTG HKâ€), a fully-owned subsidiary of China Three Gorges (â€œCTGâ€) â€“ to sell 49% of equity shareholding and shareholder loans in a portfolio of wind assets for a total consideration of 242 million Euros. The transaction scope covers 422 MW of wind technology, located in Portugal, with an average age of 6 years. These assets were part of ENEOP project and have been fully consolidated at EDPR following the conclusion of the asset split process in 2015. Ordinances 268-B/2016 and 69/2017 The Portuguese Government through the DirecÃ§Ã£o-Geral de Energia e Geologia (DGEG) performed an investigation for the evaluation of public policies regarding the energy sector, in which it has come to the conclusion that the renewable energy generators with feed-in tariff have received, apart from this tariff incentive, public support for the promoting and development of renewable energy. DGEG's investigation estimated an amount of 140 million Euros as an excess over what they should have received. On 13 October 2016, Ordinance 268-B/2016 was published, determining the recovery to SEN of the amount allegedly received in excess, through feed-in tariff reduction granted by the Last resource supplier (CUR). On 28 December 2016, Law 46/2016 was published. The article 171, determined that the public support for the promoting and development of renewable energy received by the eligible energy generators with feed-in tariff (at this date) should not be cumulative with the administratively fixed remuneration received by those generators. In this sense, this article determines the adoption, through an ordinance, of a mechanism for deduction or replacement of the public support received under these conditions. Thus, in 16 February 2017, Ordinance 69/2017 was published which determining the recovery to SEN of the amount allegedly received in excess, through feed-in tariff reduction granted by the CUR. This ordinance replicate the content of the Ordinance 268-B/2016 repealing it. The publishing of orders from the State member responsible for the energy sector is expected, that will identify the producers and the amounts which one of them shouldn't have received, in order to calculate the new feed-in tariff that allows this amount to be recovered as fast as it is possible. For Renewable energy generators under this situation, which have already lost their right to feed-in tariffs, it establishes that it is the CUR who has the responsibility to recover the amounts identified by DGEG, though it is not clear in what way will they recover these amounts. Half of the amount recovered under this mechanism will reduce tariff deficit, being the other half allocated to future yearly tariffs. EDPR awarded long term contracts for 127 MW at the Italian wind auction EDPR was awarded 20-year long term contracts at the Italian wind auction to sell electricity to be produced by 6 wind farms with a total capacity of 127 MW. The wind farm projects are located in the south of Italy, with installation expected to occur in 2018.

This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This new standard presents the principles that shall be applied by an entity in order to provide more useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, term and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a client. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, as provided in the 5 steps methodology. The 5 steps methodology consists in the following steps: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and (v) recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. â— IFRS 16 â€“ Leases The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in January 2016, IFRS 16 - Leases, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted for entities that have also adopted IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, and supersedes IAS 17 - Leases and its associated interpretative guidance. The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information to the users of financial statements, namely about the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity. The main issues considered are as follows: - inclusion of some considerations in order to distinguish leases from service contracts, based on the existence of control of the underlying asset at the time that it is available for use by the lessee; and - introduction of a single lessee accounting model that requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. As a consequence, a lessee recognises depreciation costs and interest costs separately. â— IAS 7 (Amended) - Disclosure Initiative The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in January 2016, amendments to IAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. These amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes, such as: - Changes from financing cash flows; - Changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses; - The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates; or - Changes in fair values. These disclosures may be presented by providing a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities.  The standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group with no significant impact are the following: â— IFRS 4 (Amended) - Applying IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts; â— IFRS 14 - Regulatory Deferral Accounts; â— IAS 12 (Amended) - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses; â— IFRIC 22 - Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Payments; â— Annual Improvement Project (2014-2016).  282  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015  70   ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ANNUAL EDPR EDPR 2016 REPORT 2016 EDPR 2016  41.
