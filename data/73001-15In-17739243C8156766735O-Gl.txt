CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   MessAGe fRoM the ChAiRMAn Dear Stakeholders,  In 2014, EDP Renováveis once again performed above the market and made steps toward fulfilling its vision of growing into a leading global renewable energy company in terms of value creation, innovation and sustainability. Six years after the company's IPO, EDPR reached 9.0 GW of renewable energy capacity, and produced 19.8 TWh in the year. The company is now present in 12 countries across Europe and the Americas. The green energy delivered in 2014 by EDPR corresponds to nearly 50% of the total electricity consumption of the country of Portugal, which is nearly triple the company's energy sales in 2008 and demonstrates EDPR's ability to deliver growth on a global scale. The strategic roadmap of focused growth in renewable energy pursued by EDPR and its shareholders puts us a step ahead of the industry and continues to prove successful. I remain certain that our company is playing on the right side of the energy sector, despite a recent regulatory environment with some unexpected setbacks culminating in significant cuts to regulated revenue as well as tax increases. Wind onshore is the most competitive source of energy, with the only exception of large hydro in some cases. It is clearly a preferable technology today to conventional thermal generation on a new-build basis. Even at presently low fuel prices, yet historically very volatile, wind farms with strong load factors are still competitive.  ANTÓNIO MEXIA CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   6  EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  Moreover, turbine costs and financing costs are improving in favour of wind energy. In 2014 we saw EU leaders agreeing on targets for 2030 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to 1990 and to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27%. Wind energy will play a key role toward these ambitious targets and our company will be, once again, a front-runner in the EU market. At the same time, the US will be key in EDPR development. Growth prospects are solid and magnified by comprehensive environmental legislation limiting different types of pollution, creating demand for the addition of new competitive and sustainable solutions, with wind energy as one of the leading alternatives. Later in 2015, Paris will host the UN Climate Change conference where relevant agreements on climate are expected from all the nations around the world. Last year, we updated the strategic plan set in 2012, while providing new targets for 2017. As you may know, our business plan continues to be based on three strategic references that guide our actions: 1) selective growth; 2) increased profitability; and 3) a self-funding model. Our business rebalancing towards the US market is paramount to our new strategic approach, which entails taking advantage of the outstanding market positioning that has allowed our company to seize windows of opportunities for growth at attractive returns and with controlled risks, supported by more than 1.2 GW of long-term PPAs signed since early 2013. This was possible due to the U.S. administration tax credit extension to support renewable energy, but most of all due to the high quality of our pipeline, one that was well-matched by our development teams and well-marketed by our highly skilled origination teams, having made EDPR a front-runner in closing PPAs in the U.S. market over the last two years. Two other key achievements in 2014 are especially worth highlighting: the entry into the Mexican wind energy market through the signing of a PPA for 180 MW to be built in 2016, and the award in France of 1 GW offshore wind capacity to a consortium participated by EDPR, for construction the end of the decade. Another key strategic pillar that EDPR and EDP both share concerns securing a controlled risk environment and maintaining access to competitive funding. The company is committed to a self-funding model for its investment plan of  2.5 billion for 2014-17, of which  700 million will be covered by asset rotation proceeds. More than 60% of this target is already completed and closed at competitive multiples, highlighting the success of the program. On top of this we are also advancing in the execution of the ongoing strategic partnership established between EDP and CTG, with minority sales involving EDPR stakes in Portugal and Brazil, including two MoU for completion expected in the year of 2015. EDPR is a solid company with an adequate strategic approach in a sector with an auspicious future, yet full of challenges. The company is still set to achieve relevant growth targets toward 2017, aiming at annualised growth rates of 9% in green electricity generation, 9% in EBITDA and 11% in Net Profit while adding over 2.0 GW of capacity from 2013.  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  7  In 2014, EBITDA was 903M and Net Income was 126M, -2% and -7% below the prior year, respectively. The results were impacted by the recent regulatory changes in Spain and amplified by exceptional low pool prices in the first months of the year. Despite those challenges, EDPR's results demonstrate great resilience, thanks to the company's rebalanced growth strategy and superior operating achievements. The company has a dividend pay-out ranging between 25% and 35% of annual Net Profit that contributes to leveraging our shareholders' returns. Hence, the proposal to be presented at the General Shareholders Meeting of 0.04 per share, within the policy defined. Evidence of this leverage of our shareholders' returns is the increase of +40% in the share price of EDPR during 2014, significantly outperforming the PSI20 (loosing -27%) and the DJ SX6E (gaining +12%). Our mission of clean and carbon-free energy generation is evidently of great meaning to our leadership role in sustainability, together with our values of support to society and respect for biodiversity. We reinforce our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact initiative to align our business with its principles in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. EDPR this year once again helped its primary shareholder (EDP) achieve a world leadership position in the Utilities Sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are proud of everything we have achieved thus far as a company that currently has a staff of more than 900 people worldwide. The stakes are high yet we maintain a vivid enthusiasm to continue progressing, pursuing greater achievements and attaining better results well into the future. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Board of Directors for their support and, most of all, to express my gratitude for the strong dedication and great work of our employees who I truly consider the stars of our success story at EDPR. The future will continue to hold great challenges for our sector. However, being the great company we are, I am confident we will successfully identify and seize opportunities for improvement and growth. Sincerely,  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   JOãO MANSO NETO VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CEO  inteRVieW With the Ceo  Q1  In review, what were EDPR's most important accomplishments in 2014?  A1: EDPR made some significant accomplishments in 2014 that had an immediate impact, and, in my opinion, we have also achieved some great things that stand to have positive impact for years to come. We have again achieved record high levels of efficiency not only in technical availability, which was above our target of 97.5%, but also in load factor, this year again at 30%, and in controlling costs, with OpEx/ MW decreasing by -8% compared to the prior year. In terms of growth we have added nearly 0.5 GW of new capacity, with the U.S. as a core market making up 329 MW of that.  Perhaps more importantly, we have created visibility for our growth in the future by signing PPAs and winning public tenders. Since 2013, EDPR has signed PPAs and won tenders for future onshore wind farms through 2017, including 1,255 MW in the U.S., 290 MW in Europe, 236 MW in Brazil and 180 MW in a new market that EDPR just entered in 2014 ­ Mexico. Furthermore, EDPR was a front-runner in the U.S. market closing PPAs over the last two years, with a total of 1.5 GW, including not only future projects, but also projects already in operation. Our entrance into the Mexican energy market is another highlight of the year. It represents a sizeable entrance into a low risk and attractive emerging market and is a great strategic fit for our company.

Another important accomplishment was the award of 1 GW offshore wind, via a competitive bid, to a consortium that includes EDPR in France. This project enlarges and further diversifies our company's long-term profitable growth options with an innovative technology that combines well with wind onshore where we have distinctive capabilities.  with over 1 billion market capitalization. I think this outstanding performance, following the clarification of Spanish regulation, makes a very clear statement on the market outlook for the consistency of our strategy and our ability to deliver the business plan we presented last May.  Q3  Sustainability is at the top of the strategic agenda for most corporations in this day and age. What is EDPR's take?  Q2  How was EDPR's financial performance for the year?  A2: In terms of profitability, the results obtained by our company over the financial year showed great resilience in a harsh environment, particularly in some of our markets in Europe. EBITDA of 903 million, declined year-on-year by only -2% (17 million), despite the negative performance of -25% (75 million) seen in Spain. This can be mostly explained by the well-known regulatory changes in this market, but results were also extraordinarily aggravated by a lower pool price than would be expected under normal conditions. During the first months of the year, when wind energy output was at the highest and hydro output was also very high, wholesale prices dropped significantly. That came ahead of the announcement of the new regulation and did not allow for the implementation of suitable hedging. Forward hedging is now in place since 2Q14 and in 2015 our exposure to wholesale prices is limited. Following our self-funding model, we have generated enough cash for our needs, delivering solid operating cash-flow of 707 million, which increased year-onyear by +4%. Total cash net investments during the year amounted to 538 million, but were practically covered by proceeds from tax equity or other project finances, as well as our asset rotation program. In 2014 we closed more than 400 million in asset rotation transactions. With those transactions alone, more than 60% of our target for the 2014-17 period has already been met and has closed at competitive multiples. Net income of 126 million was just 9 million lower than the prior year, with EBITDA performance and the bottom line also mitigated by some positive one-offs, in particular the decrease in deferred taxes following the announced income tax rate reduction in Spain. Notwithstanding the results as on the books, the evolution in the company's market valuation as reflected in EDPR's share price increase of 40% in 2014, significantly outperforms the DJ Eurostoxx Utilities SX6E (+12%) and NYSE Euronext Lisbon PSI20 (-27%). In fact, EDPR was named the best performing stock in the NYSE Euronext Lisbon, among companies  A3: Sustainability is at the basis of EDPR's existence. Our company has long had the vision to be a global renewable energy company that is a leader in value creation, innovation and sustainability. In fact we took this approach before many others in the industry anticipated and began to respond to the global macro trends that have been moving us toward abundant, clean and affordable energy. Those trends have made renewable energy a success story worldwide that accounts for an increasing share of total production. It is naturally related to the clear benefits to the environment and to society, but also related to the proven economic competitiveness of renewable energy, and wind onshore in particular.  it's not onLY ABoUt WhAt We do As A BUsiness, it's ALso ABoUt hoW We do it: oUR Attention to LoCAL CoMMUnities, ResPeCt foR BiodiVeRsitY, And ContRoLLed RisK APPRoACh. At EDPR, as one of the first movers in wind energy, we built significant capacity early on and since then have maintained a top position in the world ranking of wind energy production players. This leadership position on the "right side of the energy sector", and the knowledge and reputation we have accumulated over time in our business has been EDPR's central competitive strength in expanding our growth and profitability.  Q4  What steps has EDPR taken to become a leader in Sustainability?  A4: For us is not only about what we do as a business, it is also about how. This is reflected, for example, in our controlled risk financial approach, our respect for biodiversity and mitigating potential impacts, and in our attention to local communities. I'd like to make special mention of the work of Fundación EDP, which also represents EDP Group's other subsidiaries in Spain. With its mission of social responsibility it has developed several initiatives in support of communities in different areas including culture, education and environmental research. At EDPR, we are publicly committed to the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environment and anti-corruption. I can highlight a few of our initiatives over the past year that demonstrate our commitment  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   10  EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  to these principles. First, we completed the OHSAS 18001 certification for nearly all our facilities, ensuring appropriate working conditions and practices in order to meet our zero accidents objective. It was an important step that shows our commitment to the health and safety of our employees and contractors. In the environmental area we reached another important milestone by completing the implementation of our environmental management system in the U.S. and reaching almost all of our sites with ISO 14001 certification, holding strict environmental practices that meet internal targets, not just legal requirements. In terms of governance, we formalized our anti-corruption policy regarding the adoption of best business practices and ethical principles, further emphasizing transparency and accountability of our governance model. We are proud to be recognized for our excellence in the area of sustainability with our presence in the FTSE4Good index and, more significantly, by the increased interest of SRI (sustainable and responsible investment) funds in our company. Last year we defined 10 sustainability targets through 2017, in line with our business plan, that not only follow our culture of continuous improvement but also reinforce sustainability to remain a central part of EDPR's future.  technology is as competitive as wind onshore. Security of supply concern will put more emphasis on a greater reliance on endogenous sources of energy, following the crisis between Ukraine and Russia. Therefore Europe will still see dynamic growth over the coming years, with activity to take up as existing oversupply is absorbed by catching demand. Prospects in the Americas are brighter at this moment, driven by a significantly stronger wind resource driving even greater competitiveness of wind energy vis-àvis other technologies. This is valid considering the availability of shale gas, and at currently low prices. The growth in the U.S. is also motivated by the need to meet environmentally driven target renewable portfolio standards (RPS). Many states, especially in the Western and Eastern regions, have increasing binding targets up to 2020 and thereafter. The U.S. administration has recently unveiled a plan to reduce carbon emissions from power generation plants. That implies a greater reliance on renewable energy sources, to make up 1/4 of the planned reduction by 2030. Moving south, Brazil and Mexico are reinforcing their regulatory support, mostly through organised tenders and favourable preferable financing conditions. Those are the most promising wind centres in Latin America, having very strong wind resources, and high growth in electricity consumption and an increasing concern over the diversification from excessive dependence on hydro and the associated potential power shortages or peak prices from droughts.  Q5  What is your outlook on the energy business and regulatory environments? A5: Clearly the global macro trends in favour of renewable energy will remain globally strong. There will be a strong need for an abundant, clean and affordable energy. Wind onshore in particular is not just environmentally friendly, it is competitive with all other alternative technologies, even at the current fuel prices.  Q6  How do you see the market design evolving going forward?  Wind onshoRe is not JUst enViRonMentALLY fRiendLY, it is CoMPetitiVe With ALL ALteRnAtiVe teChnoLoGies, eVen At CURRent fUeL PRiCes. In Europe, the focus is certainly moving from decarbonisation, evident in the 20-20-20 targets and 2030 targets, toward affordability. However, the short-term outlook in Europe faces some challenges due to a big misperception about the true cost/ benefit of renewable energy, created in the context of a worldwide recession that triggered a focus on their remuneration schemes. They intended to show that these schemes had excessive costs, but they were grounded in incorrect analyses, putting into question the existing regulation to support new growth. The truth is that on a levelized cost of energy basis, with the exception of large hydro in some cases, no other  A6: The industry will see increasing importance of auction-based structures (tenders, PPAs). This system is already well developed in the Americas, and now we are observing a switch in Europe, which in my view is a very welcome market design, since auctions provide long-term visibility with low risk for investors and, at the end, lower prices to electricity consumers. The wind energy industry does not need subsidies but stability, for example from market-based arrangements of competition ex-ante competition. The U.S. has efficient regulatory support, albeit visibility over the long-term extension of the incentives in place, PTC mostly, is limited. It would be valuable to have at least a medium-term view on these deals, even if including a progressive phasing out, as it would allow for improved planning and better value for consumers. The situation as it is creates a volatile growth market  Wind eneRGY does not need sUBsidies BUt stABiLitY, foR exAMPLe fRoM MARKet-BAsed ARRAnGeMents of ex-Ante CoMPetition.

The importance of the PTC for value creation is lower today than some years ago due to the improvement in wind energy competitiveness. Today a new wind farm in the Central region of the U.S. with the best load factors to achieve our required returns, can offer a utility a PPA price for 20-year competitive with the cost one can expect from any other new-build.  will be building our first project by 2016 with 180-200 MW awarded with a 25-year contract. We will continue to actively prospect further opportunities in these countries or in other emerging markets with these same strong fundamentals. But again, our diversified worldwide presence and extensive portfolio of high quality projects will enable us to select the optimal mix of investments at each moment.  Q7  What are the implications of this context on growth prospects?  Q8  What about new technologies?  A7: Our business plan aims to maintain capacity growth at a rate of 500 MW annually through 2017, focused on high quality projects, mostly through long-term energy sale agreements already granted, lowering our exposure to wholesale prices and regulatory schemes. Taking advantage of our diversified worldwide presence and extensive portfolio of projects that allow us to pick the most interesting markets at each time, future growth is projected to be located 60% in U.S., 20% in Europe and the remaining 20% in emerging wind markets. In the U.S., since the one-year extension of PTCs in early 2013, we have signed PPAs for 1,255 MW of capacity putting us in clear reach of our growth target in this market, of which 300 MW were already added in 2014. We now have several projects to add in the U.S. during 2015, 2016 and 2017.  A8: Regarding technologies other than wind onshore, we have already somewhat diversified into solar photovoltaic (PV), but such investments are something more to be judged on a case-by-case opportunistic approach like the case of the 30 MW addition this year in U.S. (California). Yet with the expectable further reduction in the levelized cost of energy of this technology, we are reviewing options to reinforce in this area. In offshore wind we are making investments in solid projects, with very strong partners such as Repsol in the UK and more recently GDF Suez and Neoen in France. The technology is not yet mature, there is a large scope for cost reduction and we believe we can leverage our core competencies in wind onshore. Wind offshore in clearly a very promising energy source and will be part of the European renewable energy growth particularly in markets where onshore development is limited.  the BUsiness PLAn is to GRoW > 500 MW PeR YeAR in hiGh QUALitY PRoJeCts UndeR LonG-teRM eneRGY sALes: 60% in U.s., 20% eURoPe And 20% in eMeRGinG Wind MARKets. In Europe, we have set a target of 20% of the overall additions through 2017. Additions will mostly come in France, Italy and Poland. However in the long term energy demand will certainly recover and EU 2030 targets already indicate renewable energy will be again on the rise. Therefore we may seem to be dormant but in fact we are active, maintaining the ongoing optimization of our pipeline up to a readyto-build stage to originate new projects, whenever we find opportunities under regulatory arrangements favourable to our profitable and sustainable growth. We will most likely participate in future public tenders that are expected in several countries where we are already present. Last but not least, in Brazil, a market with strong fundamentals, the action plan is to prepare new projects to participate in the forthcoming PPA auction; and logically we are already on the path to complete the 237 MW awarded through PPAs back in 2011 and 2013. Mexico is another promising market with very strong potential that can fit in our global diversification growth plan while maintaining a low risk approach. We  Q9  Is the company going to maintain its low risk profile?  A9: Yes, absolutely. A low risk profile is in our genetic material, and naturally it is one of the key pillars our strategy since we consider essential to maintain a competitive cost of capital. This culture of controlled risk is observed in our strict risk management practices, reflected most noticeably in our hedging from any material exposure to wholesale market prices, either through regulation or via bilateral PPAs. Only about 10% of our generation is exposed to market spot prices, a level considered adequate for a low risk profile. It is also reflected in our management of financial debt, with 86% at fixed cost and maturing in three years or later -, in our hedging of foreign exchange risk, and just to highlight a few of our risk management principles. We will continue to follow a rigorous financial policy, only assuming financial commitments when we have the means secured to do so. This is particular relevant in our business particularly capital intensive and moreover observing our current investment plan amounting to 2.5 billion over the four years started in 2014.  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   12  EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  Q10  How does EDPR plan to finance such large investment plan?  Q11  What else can still be done to increase profitability?  A10: As you may know, we have committed ourselves to what we call a self-funding model, in which we limit the financing of our investment plan exclusively to our internal free cash flow from operating assets as well as the sale of minority stakes in our projects. Bringing forward the cash flow from our assets allows us to increase our value and growth through its reinvestment while still preserving a balance sheet discipline that maintains the company under a low risk and cost competitive financing environment. Our business plan embraces the goal of raising 700 million from such asset rotation proceeds that complement an amount of 1.8 billion of operating cash flow to finance our total 2.5 billion investment plan. With 2014 transactions alone, over 60% of this target has already been completed, through three deals involving assets located in different countries with different pension funds and infrastructure funds as counterparties. Also worth mentioning here is another agreement closed under EDP's strategic partnership with China Three Gorges at the end of 2014, this time for the 49% sale of our operating and under development capacity in Brazil. This follows the first transaction in Portugal which included assets where EDPR was majority shareholder, as well as a Memorandum of Understanding for the sale of a minority stake to be executed subsequent to the splitting of assets at the ENEOP consortium that will take place in 2015.  A11: We have set a target for ourselves to increase EBITDA and Net Profit respectively by 9% and 11% annually on average from 2013 over the next four years. To do that, we will invest in projects with higher load factor, which will generate stronger output than our assets in operation, and we will deliver increased operational efficiency. These objectives will allow for an increase in electricity output of 9% and cut OpEx/MW by -2% on average per year from last year up to 2017. It is always a key concern to deliver the planned growth both on time and on budget, and we have a strong track record in doing just that, which we intend to maintain. On the operations side, we will make continuous improvements in availability levels as well as small but important boosts in load factors thanks to productivity enhancements that we are implementing in turbines already in operation. We will also reduce costs through the dissemination of best practices and leaner approaches, as well as through the internalization of value adding activities in maintenance.  Q12  Finally, as the CEO of EDPR, what are your feelings toward the company? A12: It has been a great privilege to be CEO for the last three years leading a team of what I frankly feel to be an outstanding group of people - over 900 now ­ contributing their great work to our mission as a corporation, and doing this with dedication above expectations and great enthusiasm. It makes my job a lot easier to be in such good company of competent professionals and adaptable individuals. In its essence, a company is its people, and it is a great competitive advantage for us to have here a great team of very experienced experts, who are in fact the pioneers of the wind industry, working together with very qualified younger professionals whom we have brought on board along the way. Our business has been shaken by numerous challenges, and I am personally grateful for the adaptability, both functional and geographical, demonstrated by many of our employees. I am also thankful to the support to our shareholders, always providing a solid backing to our strategy and stimulating myself and my colleagues at the Executive team to accomplish our mission in the company even better and better.

Most importantly, the primary source of funds will still be the operating cash flow generated from the existing assets, expected to amount to 3.5 billion in 201417 period, which will remain to a significant extent available to fund the new investments.  oUR BUsiness PLAn eMBRACes the GoAL of RAisinG 700 MiLLion fRoM Asset RotAtion PRoCeeds thAt WiLL heLP finAnCe oUR 2.5 BiLLion inVestMent PLAn.  in its essenCe, A CoMPAnY is its PeoPLe. oUR BUsiness hAs Been shAKen BY nUMeRoUs ChALLenGes And i AM PeRsonALLY GRAtefUL foR the AdAPtABiLitY of oUR eMPLoYees.

We do so through four major guiding commitments: Comprehend, Communicate, Collaborate and Trust. These commitments underlie a policy that aims to go beyond mere compliance with the formal requirements of the law, thereby contributing to an effective and genuine engagement of our different stakeholders.  COMPREHEND Include, Identify, Prioritize: We have dynamically and systematically identified the Stakeholders that influence and are influenced by the Company, and we analyse and try to understand their expectations and interests in the decisions that directly impact on them.  COMMUNICATE Inform, Listen, Respond: We are committed to promoting two-way dialogue with Stakeholders through information and consulting initiatives. We listen, inform and respond to Stakeholders in a consistent, clear, rigorous and transparent manner, with the aim of building strong, durable close relationships.  COLLABORATE Integrate, Share, Cooperate, Report: We aim to collaborate with Stakeholders to build strategic partnerships that bring together and share knowledge, skills and tools, thereby promoting the creation of shared value in a differentiating manner.  TRUST Transparency, Integrity, Respect, Ethics: We believe that the promotion of a climate of trust with our Stakeholders is crucial to establishing stable, longterm relationships. Our relationship with stakeholders is based on values like transparency, integrity and mutual respect.  Who are the stakeholders of EDPR? All persons or entities that influence or are influenced by our activities. They are organized in four segments: Democracy, Value Chain, Market and Social and Territorial Context. In 2014, the company has initiated in Spain its stakeholders management plan consisting of 5 main phases: 1) segmentation, 2) definition of stakeholders managers to follow up on the implementation of improvement initiatives, 3) quantitative analysis through a number of internal and external inquiries, 4) preparation of a conclusions report once the data relative to inquiries have been consolidated, and 5) action plan to be implemented by each of the stakeholder managers and coordinated by a steering committee. This plan will be replicated in other countries in the future with the goal of obtaining a global vision of the company's relationships with stakeholders across its different locations. The table below lists the different interested parties, aggregated by described four key segments of stakeholders, interacting with our business in Spain: Segment Market Stakeholder Financial Entities Investors Competition Energy Commission of Spanish Congress Democracy Spanish Euro Congressmen Political parties Employees Value Chain Suppliers Land Owners Associations Social and Territorial Environment Local Communities Universities City Councils Energy Council or Energy Commissioners Media and Opinion Leaders AIN CH VALUE Suppliers employees  M A  ET K R Financial Entities  Competition  DE M O C Government R Public Bodies Regulation  Y C A  Parliament and Polítical Parties  Shareholders Investors  International Institutions  trade unions  Employees  NGO  Local Communities  Scientific Community  social economy consumer & business associations  Local Government  Customers residential customers  large customers rbit po ed  Media and Opinion Makers  commercial industrial customers customers  L IA C SO       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15  &  TE RR ITO RIA L EN VIRONMENT      20     18  EDPR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR ·· 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  EDPR organized a day of festivities in celebration of Global Wind Day at its Rabosera wind farm in Aragon (Spain) and in Leroy, Minnesota (USA)  INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE CELEBRATION OF GLOBAL WIND DAY ARE AN INDICATION OF THE COMMITMENT TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE MUNICIPALITIES WHERE EDPR OPERATES EDPR celebrated Global Wind Day, a worldwide event that occurs annually on June 15, with a day of festivities at the Rabosera wind farm, located between the towns of Luna (Zaragoza) and Gurrea de Gállego (Huesca) in Spain. To celebrate this day, the Rabosera wind farm opened their doors to the public for guided educational tours of the facilities, accompanied by technical personnel, and visits to a wind tunnel. The day also incorporated educational sessions for children and design competitions. The event was attended by the head of the Energy and Mining Department of the Regional Government of Aragon, Marina Sevilla. She was accompanied by Ramón Tejedor, an advisor from the same department, and the director of the Huesca Local Industry and Innovation Service, Marta Patricia Rodríguez. Also present were a number of local representatives and officials from neighbouring cities. According to Rocío Sicre, Country Manager for EDPR in Spain, "initiatives like this are part of the sustainable philosophy of the company and a clear indication of our commitment to the local communities in the municipalities where we operate". In the United States, the EDPR team in Leroy, Minnesota, was responsible for organizing events for Wind Day at the Pioneer Prairie and Prairie Star wind farms. In partnership with the LeRoy School, EDPR provided an afternoon of learning about science and engineering with a focus on wind energy. EDPR taught the students about the environmental impacts of renewable energies. After the students left, it was the turn of congressional advisors, journalists and tax consultants from Iowa and Minnesota, who learned about the O&M (Operations and Maintenance) of wind farms. The trip ended with a reception on site which served as a networking opportunity      CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15        EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  21 19  1.2. 2014 IN REVIEW 1.2.1.

It employs the latest in turbine technology to generate 200 MW of domestic, renewable electricity enough to power more than 51,000 average Indiana homes with clean energy each year, preventing the annual emission of tons carbon dioxide - a contributor to climate change, nitrogen oxide which causes smog, and sulphur dioxide which causes acid rain. The annual environmental benefits of the 332,000 tons of CO2 are equivalent to taking approximately 183,000 cars off of the road.  Old and new wind power at Headwaters  More than 200 supportive landowners were attracted to participate in long-term lease and easement agreements that cover turbines, access roads and transmission corridors. EDPR also performed wind measures at the site during years to design the best layout for the terrain.  DEVELOPMENT  Construction works started and finished during 2014. The wind farm has a total of 100 turbines, 94.5 meters tall. It is connected to the grid at 345 kilovolt transmission line through a new substation, 10 miles transmission line and interconnection station. The project includes maintaining 80 miles of public roads and more than 35 miles of private access roads to the turbines. More than 250 direct and indirect jobs were created at the peak of construction.  CONSTRUCTION  EDPR created 14 full time permanent jobs in the area to help operate the power plant at the highest efficiency standards. The Headwaters wind farm helps provide energy security to the United States by diversifying the electricity generation portfolio, protecting against volatile natural gas spikes and utilizing a renewable, domestic source of energy.  OPERATIONS  Headwaters wind farm does not impede land use for Indiana farmers       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       1.2.2.

GOVERNANCE MODEL  EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  25 23  Corporate governance is about promoting corporate fairness, transparency and accountability. EDPR's corporate governance structure specifies the shareholders, board of directors, managers and other stakeholders' rights and responsibilities and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions on corporate affairs. It also incorporates the organization's strategic response to risk management.  THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MODEL OF EDPR, AS A LISTED CORPORATION, IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH A CLEAR SEPARATION OF DUTIES BETWEEN MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION OF THE COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES.  The corporate governance structure adopted is the one in effect in Spain. It comprises a General Meeting of Shareholders and a Board of Directors that represents and manages the company. As required by the law and established in the company's articles of association, the Board of Directors has set up four specialized committees. These are the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee and the Committee on Related-Party Transactions. This governance structure and composition was chosen to adapt the company's corporate governance model also to the Portuguese legislation and it seeks, insofar it is compatible with the Spanish law, to correspond to the so-called "Anglo-Saxon" model set forth in the Portuguese Commercial Companies Code, in which the management body is a Board of Directors, and the supervision and control duties are of the responsibility of a separate body, a Supervisory Board. EDPR's model attempts then to establish compatibility between two different systems of company law, through an Audit and Control Committee of independent members, although not exclusively separate from the Board of Directors. The experience of institutional operation of this adopted governance model has been proving to be appropriate to the organizational development of the company's activities, because it still affords transparency and accountability between the management functions of the Executive Committee, the supervisory functions of the Audit and Control Committee and the specialized oversight by other different Board of Directors committees.  GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS: · is the body where the shareholders participate; · has the power to deliberate and adopt decisions, by majority, on matters reserved by the law or the articles of association.  · may also delegate executive powers to the ViceChairperson; · must meet at least 4 times a year, preferably once a quarter; nonetheless, the Chairperson, on his own initiative or that of 3 Directors, shall convene a meeting whenever he deems fit for the company's interests; · its decisions are adopted by absolute majority among the Directors present in the meeting, where each Director has one vote and the Chairperson has the casting vote in the event of a tie; The Chairperson of the BOD fully represents the company, using its name, implementing decisions of the General Meeting of Shareholders, Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. Without prejudice to the powers of the Chairperson under the law and the articles of association, he also has the powers of convening and presiding over the meetings of the BOD, establishing their agenda and directing discussions and decisions; acting as the company's highest representative dealing with public, sectorial or employers' bodies; The BOD has set up four specialized committees. These are the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee and the Committee on Related-Party Transactions. The members of these committees shall maintain their positions in the respective committees for as long as they are Directors; nonetheless, the BOD may decide to discharge members at any time and the members may resign said positions while still remaining Directors.

ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE The organization structure is designed to accomplish the strategic management of the company but also a transversal operation of all the business units, ensuring alignment with the defined strategy, optimizing support processes and creating synergies. EDPR organizational structure is divided in 3 key elements: a corporate center at the Holding and 2 platforms Europe & Brazil and North America. Within EDPR Europe & Brazil platform, there are 8 business units, one for each of the countries where the company operates, namely Spain, Portugal, France/Belgium, Italy, Poland, Romania, UK and finally Brazil. Similarly in the EDPR North America platform, there are 3 business units, that represent the operational regions in the continent: West (includes Canada), Central (includes Mexico) and East.  EDPR  Europe & Brazil  North America  Spain  Portugal  France/ /Belgium  Poland  Romania  Italy  United Kingdom  Brazil  West (i. Canada)  Central (i Mexico)  East  ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL PRINCIPLES The model is designed with several principles in mind to ensure optimal efficiency and value creation. Accountability alignment Client-service Critical KPIs and span of control are aligned at project, country, platform and holding level to ensure accountability tracking and to take advantage of complementarities derived from end-to-end process vision. Corporate areas function as competence support centers and are internal service providers to all business units for all geographical non-specific needs. Business priorities and needs are defined by local businesses and best practices are defined and distributed by corporate units. Execution of activities at holding level are held only when significant value is derived, coherently with defined EDPR holding role.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 2.1.1. RENEWABLE ENERGY BENEFITS Renewable energy is helping improve energy security, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and push electricity prices down, it is also triggering high returns for the domestic economies by generating local added value and job creation. The evolution of renewable energy over the past decade has surpassed all expectations. Global installed capacity from all renewable technologies have increased significantly; costs for most technologies have decreased considerably. In 2013, renewables accounted for more than 56% of net additions to global power capacity and represented far higher shares of capacity added in several countries. Renewable energy provided an estimated 19% of global final energy consumption in 2013 and continued to grow in 2014. Markets, manufacturing, and investment expanded further across the developing world, and it became increasingly evident that renewables are no longer dependent upon a small handful of countries. By early 2014, at least 144 countries had renewable energy targets and 138 countries had renewable energy support policies in place. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global renewable energy share can reach and exceed 30% by 2030 and the technologies are already available today to achieve this objective and around 40% of the total renewable energy potential in 2030 is in power generation. IEA 2014 Energy Outlook expects the share of renewables in total power generation to rise from 21% in 2012 to 33% in 2040, and to supply nearly half of the growth in global electricity generation. Renewable electricity generation, including hydropower, is expected nearly triple over 2012-2040, overtaking gas as the second-largest source of generation in the next couple of years and surpassing coal as the top source after 2035. Within renewables, wind onshore is clearly the leader. The most remarkable recent development is that in an increasing number of markets, wind power is the least cost option when adding new generation capacity to the grid, and prices continue to fall. Wind is today one of the biggest, cheapest, and fastest way to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants, and simultaneously uses no water. There are now commercial wind power installations in more than 90 countries with total installed capacity of close to 370 GW at the end of 2014, providing about 3% of global electricity supply in 2013. Analysts from Bloomberg New Energy Finance predict that wind will account for the largest share of the 30% of new renewables added to the global power grid by 2030. The GWEC Moderate scenario envisages wind would meet between 7.2% and 7.8% of global electrical demand in 2020, and between 12.9% and 14.5% in 2030. Growth in wind installations will lead to a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions, create jobs for hundreds of thousands of people and contribute to GDP growth. Wind energy also offers major advantages for geopolitical reasons: wind is widely available throughout the world and can help reduce energy and fuel import dependency and improves the security of supply, stabilizing and reducing the cost of power generation over the long term.

As power prices are determined by the intersection of power supply and demand, bids at zero displace more expensive technologies shifting, consequently, the supply curve. For a same level of demand, when wind production is available, the market price goes down (the so-called "merit order effect"). An increasing supply of renewable energy in Europe is pushing down wholesale electricity prices in most markets. IMPROVE ENERGY SECURITY By investing in renewable energy, countries reduce their     According to EWEA's "Wind energy and electricity prices" report prepared by Pöyry this merit order effect caused by wind results in electricity price reductions of 3 to 23  per MWh. In Germany, with a share of 27.3%, renewables took first place, replacing lignite for the largest share in energy consumption in 2014. As a result, the wholesale price for power decreased to a record low of 33 per MWh (38 in 2013). This allowed the German energy market to export to neighbour countries a record 5.6% of energy produced.  energy dependency by enhancing their security of energy supply and minimizing their exposure to potential increases in fuel prices. This happens because wind, solar  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15          32 30      EDPR 2014 MANAGEMENT REPORT EDPR ·· 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  and hydro technologies use endogenous resources. On the opposite side, fuel resources are scarce and concentrated in some geographies which explains its high and volatile price. During 2011 Europe spent 406 billion on importing fossil fuels rising to 545 billion in 2012.The EU is highly dependent on fossil-fuel import from Russia, particularly natural gas. Current political conflict between Ukraine and Russia may risk supply and is opening again Europe's energy independence discussions. According to the European Commission, in 2010 renewables avoided 30 billion in imported fuel costs. During the same year, the IEA estimates that cost of support for renewable energy in the EU was 26 billion, highlighting that the cost of supporting renewable energy  is offset by the avoided costs of importing fossil fuels alone. EWEA states in their "Avoiding fossil fuel costs with wind energy" report that in 2012 wind energy avoided 9.6 billion of fossil fuel costs. Depending on the decarbonisation scenario they assume for the future, they estimate wind energy will avoid between 22 billion and 27 billion of fuel costs annually in 2020. Wind power also provides a valuable hedge against fuel price volatility, protecting both utilities and consumers. Utilities are able to lock in fixed, long-term contracts with wind power, protecting consumers against price spikes by providing a long-term hedge against volatile future prices for fuel. In particular in US, financiers are conscious about the volatility in US gas prices and the likelihood that they will rise.  RENEWABLE ENERGY EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMY COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE The power sector is responsible for more than 40% of all carbon dioxide emissions, and about 25% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions need to peak and decline in this decade to meet climate change goals. Despite efforts to the decarbonisation of the energy sector and the various measures announced by governments, the main scenario of the IEA forecasts an increase in emissions by about 20% by 2040. This increase in emissions is consistent with a global temperature increase of 3.6°C in the long run, which is beyond the 2°C limit (internationally accepted to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change). Promoting a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable energy is one of the most effective and feasible near-term ways of mitigating climate change. Wind and solar power's scalability, speed of deployment and falling costs make them the best choice to achieve the emissions reductions. These sources are not only carbon free, but also do not emit harmful SOx, NOx or mercury pollution, protecting valuable air and water resources. Reducing emissions is also beneficial for the economy. According to IRENA Average health benefits due to the mitigation of air pollution from fossil-fuel use are in the range of USD 2-5 per GJ, while carbon dioxide mitigation benefits are in the range of USD 3-12 per GJ. The total of cost and benefits results in net savings of at least USD 123 billion, and as high as USD 738 billion by 2030. JOB CREATION Renewables play an important role in employment creation and growth in the global economy. In 2013, approximately 6.5 million people were already employed in the renewable energy industry worldwide, expanding from 5.7 million in 2012, a new study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reveals. According to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), for every new MW of capacity installed in a country in a given year, 14 full-time equivalent jobs per year are created through manufacturing, component supply, wind farm development, construction, transportation, etc. competitiveness. Besides, the growth of the wind industry's contribution of the EU's GDP is greater over 2007-2010 period, than the overall growth of the EU's GDP during this same period, thus the wind sector remains strong in periods of recession. Ernst&Young report "Analysis of the value creation potential of wind energy policies", commissioned by EDPR and Acciona in 2012, shows wind energy triggers higher returns for European economies than CCGTs power generation. The study shows that the higher initial capital expenditures associated with wind energy are more than compensated by the economic benefits generated by wind energy in terms of job creation, tax revenues, energy security and abatement of CO2 emissions. In particular Ernst&Young report concludes that (i) wind energy provides a high contribution to GDP in most European countries, (ii) wind energy has significant job creation potential. In Spain and France, for example, wind power creates twice as many jobs than CCGT per million euros invested, (iii) wind energy generates more tax revenues than CCGT. Every Euro invested in wind generates between 27 and 52 euro cents in tax revenues in Europe, depending on local tax policies. In the US, according to the AWEA data, wind bolsters America's economy through a supply chain of nearly 500 manufacturing plants and over 2.500 companies investing in all stages of American wind power.  CONTRIBUTION TO GDP GROWTH The large deployment of renewables worldwide has been possible thanks to the development of the renewable industry, which, consequently, represents an increasingly share of the global economy. Wind industry development is today a key contributor to the GDP of many economies worldwide. According to a study conducted by the EWEA "The impact of wind energy on jobs and the economy" published in April 2012, the direct contribution of the wind energy sector in the EU's GDP was 17.6 billion Euros in 2010, which corresponds to 0,26% of the European GDP. The same year, the industry's net export were worth 5,7 billion euros and it´s worth noting that only 9,9% of the wind energy inputs were imported, which illustrates the European wind       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15        EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  33 31  WIND OFFSHORE IN FRANCE EDPR, in a consortium, was awarded 1 GW of offshore wind energy in France, enlarging and diversifying its long-term profitable growth options into a top economy and an innovative technology that may represent about ¼ of the company's capex by 2020. THE PROJECTS EDPR partnership created with GDF Suez, Neon Maritime and AREVA, in which EDPR holds a 43% noncontrolling stake, was selected by the French government, following a national public tender process ended last May, to develop, construct and operate two offshore wind farms in the areas of Tréport, HauteNormandie (0.5 GW) and the Isles of Yeu and Noirmoutier, Pays de la Loire (0.5 GW). The projects aim to build a local industrial ecosystem to form the emergence of robust offshore wind power sector which will generate economic activity and jobs and lay the foundations for further offshore wind energy expansion, and, at the end, are estimated to provide enough renewable energy to supply 1.6 million people when they become operational by 2021 while contributing to fight against climate change.  TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT The choice of the new AREVA 8MW wind turbine will maximize the site production while reducing up to 40% the number of turbines needed for the wind farms and therefore also reducing the time of construction and optimizing maintenance. An optimized jacket foundation technical solution is to be installed at the two sites, allowing for the free passage through them of ocean swells and fish and thus providing an environmentallyfriendly operating installation.  THE PARTNERSHIP The partners' complementary experience was key to their proposal competitiveness outstanding for its exceptional concern to sustainability and local stakeholders. GDF Suez (47%) and EDPR (43%) possess a strong expertise in renewable energy, large scale industrial projects and offshore work, with combined operating assets of 36 GW and close to 7 GW under construction worldwide and involved in the development of 19 offshore wind projects representing 5 GW. Neon Marine (10%) provides the consortium its recognized experience as a local developer in the Yeu-Noirmoutier region with great technical and environmental expertise; since its foundation in 2008 it has invested more than  6 million in development projects along the French coastline. AREVA is the industrial partner in the consortium in regard to its unique track record in the design and construction of offshore wind turbines thanks to its operation in the offshore field Alpha Ventus in the North Sea since 2009 as well as the ongoing development of 600 MW offshore projects.

COMPETITIVENESS OF WIND ENERGY It is more and more clear that wind energy is good, not only because it is green... but because it is competitive, it is in fact cheaper Wind is quickly approaching competitiveness with conventional power generation in all key global markets as cost-competitiveness continues to improve, driven by new, incremental technology improvements related to turbine size and the evolution of blade and tower technology. The financial advisory firm Lazard recently estimated that wind energy is more affordable than new natural gas or coal generation even without subsidies. Lazard's numbers show the `levelized cost of energy' (hereinafter abbreviated as LCoE) for wind power has decreased 58% since 2009, and 15% in the last year alone.  LEVELIZED COST OF ENERGY IS THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK To assess the competitiveness of various power sources the levelized cost of electricity is the relevant benchmark. The LCoE determines the average cost of producing a unit of electricity over the lifetime of the generating source. It considers, on one hand, the total quantity of electricity produced by the source, and on the other hand, all the costs incurred by the source over its lifetime, including the original capex and ongoing opex, maintenance costs, the costs of fuels and any carbon emissions costs. It also takes into account the financing costs of the project, both deducting the cost of debt, for an appropriate level of debt financing, and considering a reasonable internal rate of return.  Levelized Cost of Electricity (/MWh, EDPR analysis 2014)  150-180 110-170  110 95 85 50-85 65-80  CCGT  Coal  Nuclear  Hydro  With gas prices expected to rise over the long term, given the large expected increase in demand for gas, the threshold for renewables to beat is becoming lower, and the LCoE of wind gets competitive with CCGT alternatives. In addition, natural gas price volatility reduces the reliability and ability to predict future power prices and further decreases the attractiveness for new gas plants. Moreover, for countries with no abundant local gas resources, wind is an attractive option not to depend on exogenous sources for their electricity supply. Regulatory environment is challenging for coal, related to the compliance of environmental requirements involving emissions and water use, and therefore coal has a LCoE that is materially higher than the CCGT baseload generators, despite the rise in gas prices. With extremely high initial investment and operating expenses, nuclear LCoE is unattractive today. For example, EDF awarded contract for difference for a new power plant in the UK expected to start operation by 2023 included a price per MWh in 2012 of GBP 92.5 and GBP 279 in 2058, as stated in a report by the European Commission. Also nuclear fleets are aging and facing shutdown decisions about security concerns following the recent Fukushima disaster. Hydro generation is a viable fuel source that is competitive today, the return economics are sensitive to construction costs and capacity factor but expansion of hydro is dependent on finding suitable locations. Insolation is an important metric for solar LCoE and newer more efficient panels may capture more sunlight over time, while module costs are expected to decline due to lower material and production costs.      Wind Solar PV Wind onshore offshore  To assess the LCoE of a wind project, the key factors include wind turbine costs and financing costs. The costs of operation are minimal. There are only geographic limitations about finding available locations with favourable wind resource conditions. Wind turbine costs have declined over the years, with the average price of turbines per MW much lower on larger turbines than smaller ones. Costs decline as the trend toward larger turbines continues. Financing costs have also improved, as the asset class for wind continues to grow and mature, and the financing vehicles rely on stable cash flow generating contracts, interest rates are at historic lows also contributing to reduce the cost of capital. The outlook for wind is thus dependant on the wind levels of the areas it will be built and the cost of baseload alternatives. According to an internal analysis at EDPR, wind onshore with load factor levels of 21-26% produces a LCoE of 65-80 per MWh and is competitive to all other power generation alternatives (both conventional and renewable), with the only exception of hydro in some cases.  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15        EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  35 33  Wind offshore energy is at the start of the learning curve and is not competitive on a LCoE basis today, but according to MAKE Consulting, wind offshore shows potential to reduce LCoE by over 40% by 2025 through innovation and development of scale economies. Existing pipeline in Europe will help the industry achieve this scale making offshore more and more competitive.  WIND IS COMPETITIVE Wind energy is competitive vis-à-vis CCGTs at different oil prices and load factors, even at currently low oil prices of $40-60 per oil barrel (CCGTs competitiveness dependent on oil prices as usually utilities' long-term gas contracts are oil-indexed). LCoE /MWh  Wind vs CCGT LCoE  Load Factor 23% 34% 57%  120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 Recent prices Wind CCGT  According to an internal analysis at EDPR, wind onshore with a capex of 1.3M per MW, is competitive with CCGT at LCoE basis for example with a wind load factor of 23% and a CCGT load factor of 34% and an oil price of $60 per barrel, or with a wind load factor of 25% it is already competitive with a CCGT load factor of 34% and an oil price of $40 per barrel. This highlights the importance of wind resource availability, with just a lower than 10% increase in wind load factor offsetting 1/3 reduction in the oil price to the CCGT. Also a strong case can be made for wind farms with robust load factors, for example of 34%, that competes with conventional CCGT power plants on LCoE running at standard levels of utilization, like 57%, and for any price level of fuel. And for a wind farm running at an average level of 29% load factor, it is competitive with a CCGT running at standard level of 57% load factor from an oil price above $50 per barrel. Moreover, wind energy cost is unrelated to oil and gas prices, and thus allows for long-term cost predictability and visibility.  23% 25% 29% 34%  30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130  Oil price $/bbl  RENEWABLES AND WIND ONSHORE ENERGY AS THE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS OF 2012-2020 WORLDWIDE ADDITIONS According to IEA World Energy Outlook 2014, renewables will account for c. 40% of worldwide capacity additions of 1,618 GW in the period of 2012-2020, and of that, wind onshore will represent nearly 50%, amounting to 316 GW.  2012-2020 Worldwide Additions (GW) 2012-2020 Worldwide Additions (GW) Coal and oil Coal and oil 220 220  Gas [CATEGORY 421 NAME] [VALUE]  Renewables [VALUE] 652  Solar PV Solar PV 266  Wind Wind 316 316 Other Other 60 60 CSP CSP 10 10  Hydro Hydro 266 266  Nuclear Nuclear 57 57  This worldwide growth, excluding China, is expected to come in ¾ from areas where EDPR is already present, namely Europe (36%), North America (22%) and Latin America (16%).

THE PROJECT: The project is a wind farm to be located in a region with very strong wind resource in the state of Coahuila, in northern Mexico. The plant should start construction this year of 2015 to be in operation during 2016, being currently in a medium stage of development in terms of permitting and having a clear path to interconnection to the grid. The expected load factor for its capacity, currently designed for 180 MW, is above 40%.  THE PARTNERSHIP: The project with operate in partnership with Industrias Peñoles, a well-known Mexico-based mining group ­ renowned for its high creditworthiness and knowledge of the local market ­ with who EDPR signed a supply agreement for the electricity from this project to be delivered in self-supply regime. The contract has a duration of 25 years and the price is set in US dollars. The deal was formalised in last June in front of the Presidents of the countries of Portugal and Mexico, respectively Mr. Aníbal Cavaco Silva and Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto. At the occasion, the CEO of Peñoles also paid a visit to EDPR's Serra d'el Rei wind farm in Portugal to get a first-hand look how the company harvest the wind.  STRATEGIC FIT: Mexican energy market meets the strategic fit criteria for EDPR, in terms of selective growth, self-funded and at increased profitability. The country is home to some of the strongest winds in the world so much that wind energy technology is competitive to shale-gas fired combined cycle thermal plants, with the plus of avoiding the exposure to gas prices volatility, which furthermore must be imported. An emerging economy with fast increasing electricity demand including from energy-intensive industries looking for competitive and long-term stable factor energy costs that generate an active market for PPAs to result from bilateral negotiations or competitive bids. Under adequate conditions, there is a local financial sector capable of providing non-recourse project financing at competitive costs. One of EDPR's goals is to have 20% of its new growth in emerging markets, therefore this deal is an especially relevant achievement. Mexico is a country close to Houston in the US where EDPR has a strong base and shares the same language with Spain where EDPR has headquarters. The success of EDPR in securing new long term energy supply agreements reinforces the company's low risk profile while providing solid visibility over the company's growth prospects.  OUTLOOK: EDPR is trustful this entry will provide a platform for further growth in the Mexican market.

MARKETS CONTEXT Wind economics, energy policies and regulatory schemes/incentives drive wind energy globally. Europe should see lower, but still dynamic growth while the Americas should became the biggest growth engine. EUROPE GROWTH TO NORMALISE INCENTIVES-DRIVEN GROWTH Europe was a first mover and was the first region to see a real take-off in wind additions and share of wind output in total power mix. In 2014 renewable power installations accounted for 21 GW (or 79%) of new power capacity installations of 27 GW, according to EWEA. With nearly 12 GW of new capacity, wind accounted for 44% of new installations, totalling a cumulative installed capacity of 120 GW. About c. 7% of the power produced in Europe is now derived from wind energy. This has mostly been achieved through suitable remuneration schemes. The main reason for putting in place such incentives was originally a political push mainly motivated by environmental and security of supply concerns. This translated into the ambitious European `20-20-20' targets to be reached by the end of 2020: - a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; - a 20% share of renewables in total energy mix; - a 20% improvement in energy efficiency. Renewables as a % of primary energy consumption ­ achieved and 2020 targets: Country Germany Spain Italy U.K. France EU (28) 2004 6% 8% 6% 1% 9% 8% 2006 8% 9% 6% 2% 10% 9% 2008 9% 11% 7% 2% 11% 11% 2010 11% 14% 11% 3% 13% 13% 2011 12% 13% 12% 4% 11% 13% 2012 12% 14% 14% 4% 13% 14% 2013 13% 15% 15% 5% 14% 15% 2020E 18% 20% 17% 15% 23% 20%  According to the European Renewable Energy Council, the UE is in the trajectory to meet with its 2020 targets, but the situation varies for each country. Italy is expected to meet its target while France, Poland and Spain are expected to lag behind. Progress towards the 2020 targets will continue with a new set of targets for 2030, The EU emissions trading system (ETS) reform and an increase in competitiveness as the main drivers. In October 24th European Council reached an agreement on 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework. A binding renewable energy target of at least 27% was set at European level, a binding EU target to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels and a non-binding energy efficiency target of 27% (to be re-visited by 2020). The framework does not mention individual targets for state implementation so it is not clear how efforts will be conducted at the national level. European Institutions have now to work in the governance system to set the framework to reach this 2030 targets.  Renewable energy 2020 targets  CO2 emissions reduction  Energy efficiency  20%  20%  20%  2030 targets  At least 27%  At least 40%  At least 27%  In the past, incentives mostly took two forms: 1) a fixed feed-in tariff (most common) or an incentive on top of the achieved power price (e.g. pool + premium) 2) a green certificate on top of power price The underlying idea was that market (merchant) power prices would not be enough to generate a reasonable return for renewable producers over the life of the assets. Granting incentives to enhance or even lock-in the achieved returns over the life of a project is a way to foster growth in renewable additions.      CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       38 36  EDPR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR ·· 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  The regulatory push has been a success from the perspective of wind development and penetration. However, in the context of a worldwide recession, which triggered an increasing focus on costs efficiency and competitiveness we have seen as a consequence some remuneration schemes reduced over the recent years. This reorientation and rationalisation of renewables support is likely to restrain wind development in Europe. This now that penetration has reached c. 12% of the region's capacity. The adjustment of remuneration schemes is taking place throughout several European markets, with previous dependence on administratively set feed-in tariffs or even pool + incentives changing mostly to fixed price auctions. In Spain, following the new remuneration framework introduced in 2013, standard remunerations were defined following the definition of typified parameters, published in February 2014, which classified all possible wind farms by their year of first operation. In order to calculate the standard remuneration, the regulation takes into account the revenues that were generated in the past and estimate the premium that is necessary to achieve a 7.4% return pre-tax, throughout the whole regulatory life of the wind farms. The standard parameters that define this remuneration can be modified every three and six years. In U.K. during 2014 the Electricity Market Reform came into effect, introducing the CfD mechanism that establishes an auction system for renewables. The first contract for difference allocation round was announced and the allocation framework was disclosed. The first allocation round was expected for October but delayed until February 2015 due to third party appeals. The budget for this round is 155 M£ in 2016/17 and 235 M£ until 2020/21 for pot 2 of `less established technologies' (among which offshore wind is included). The Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC) has also indicated that it intends to hold the second allocation round in October 2015. The size of this budget has raised concerns that many offshore projects may not be able to secure funding. In France, the government began to prepare a new comprehensive law in 2014 meant to completely reshape the energy sector. The Government is considering moving from current fixed feed-in tariff scheme to a more market-oriented scheme. The draft establishes a system whereby generators could receive a premium support payment on top of the market price for electricity (CfD type scheme as in UK). However, the implementation of this new support system will require consultations by the ministry and the process is unlikely to produce quick results. In Poland, a draft proposal to change the GC scheme into fixed price scheme granted through tenders was approved by the government in April 2014 and is currently under the parliamentary approval process ­ expected to be approved in 2015 Q1. The new tender scheme will apply for assets entering operation from January 1st 2016. Besides, this new regulation foresees a transitory process for already-operating wind farms. Under this process they would be entitled to switch into a fixed price scheme through a tender (or series of tenders) specific for operating projects. In Italy an auction system based on capacity quotas has been established where tender winning projects receive a 20 year fee-in tariff. A third tender for onshore wind received applications for 1.3 GW with only 365 MW awarded, meeting the available capacity but leaving potential wind power in an indeterminate state. There is uncertainty on future development as current regulation does not foresees additional tenders and the cap on support set by law in 2012 for non PV RES in close to be met.  GROWTH STILL, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER PACE Overall, Europe should continue to grow consistently, even if at a slower pace. Improving wind economics and still stimulating green targets partially offset a less substantial regulatory support and an already sizeable installed base and penetration. On top of that, security of supply concerns will put more emphasis on a greater reliance on endogenous sources of energy, after the recent developments in Ukraine/Russia crisis. The focus has now shifted to growth at reasonable cost from a system cost competitiveness perspective, with also a reintroduced emphasis on security of supply, aiming to combine: - cost competitiveness and affordability; - reliability and security of supply; - energy efficiency and ambitious green targets. Wind power will remain a key technology in reaching these goals. Growth in installed capacity can still nearly 95 GW of additions are needed up to 2020, representing nearly 50% of total global capacity additions ex AsiaPacific, and this justifies Europe should remain a core market for wind.

Incentives as PTCs and the prevalence of PPAs also play a key role. Historically, the typical framework of wind development in the US has been decentralised, with no national feed-in tariff. It involves the combination of two key drivers of the top line: · PPAs: long-term bilateral power purchase agreements by which a wind developer can sell its output at a fixed price, usually adjusted for inflation or a negotiated escalator. Demand for PPAs has been very strong, driven mainly by the need to meet renewable portfolio standards (RPS) targets but also from increasing improving relative competitiveness of wind energy. · PTCs: production tax credits are the dominant form of wind remuneration in the US, and represent an extra source of revenue per unit of electricity ($23/MWh in 2014), over the first 10 years of the asset's life. There are other mechanisms as well, such as ITCs, investment tax credits equal to 30% of the initial capex usable in lieu of PTCs. The PPA + PTC combination allow wind energy companies to `lock-in' a return over the life of the assets. The final goals targeted by the application of this framework involve cost competiveness and affordability, security of supply and environmental concerns.  RPS DEMAND The renewable portfolio standards (RPS) are designed to require power suppliers to provide a minimum share of electricity from renewable sources, on a state-by-state basis. Over the last decades such standards have increased and by 2015 a total of 31 states have binding RPS objectives (of which 26 with targets above 8% of electricity from renewable sources), as shown in the table below, which excludes the 7 states with voluntary goals. Although those are implemented by states all-round the US, however a strong cluster is observed in the west/pacific cost and the north east. This typically represents 10% to 25% to be reached by 2020-25 for most states, and often foreseeing a gradual increase in the mandated percentage. This framework drives many utilities to setup auction systems (RFPs) to seek long-term power purchase agreements with renewable energy generators. Due to the competitiveness of wind energy, this technology has received the largest share of awarded PPAs.

Power plants are responsible for about one-third of all US greenhouse gas emissions. This plan implies greater reliance on gas (CCGTs account for c. 40% of the planned reduction emissions), but also on alternative energy sources (c. 25% of the planned reduction emissions), and especially wind.  WIND ENERGY COMPETITIVENESS The improving wind energy economics include decreasing capex and opex per MW, and even more per MWh due to the increase in load factors via technology improvements in wind turbines and also overall excellent wind resources in the US, especially in the regions with best resource available. In the west and east states, load factors are typically within 25-30%, while in the central states those are typically of 30-45%. This naturally makes wind energy further more competitive from a fundamental standpoint, even without incentives.  INCENTIVES TO REMAIN Also in the US, there are concerns regarding the cost of renewable energy incentives to tax payers and final energy consumers, mostly the PTCs. Since their inception, eligibility for these incentives has been made possible for a couple of years at a time, over a limited period, without any visibility on any further extensions. Until now, there have been always extensions, but this `stop and go' approach limits visibility on the investment horizon for wind energy companies.  US wind energy additions (GW) 13.1 9.9 8.4 PTC extension  6.8  5.1  PTC extension  4.9  U.S. Congress has recently approved, in the mid of 1.1 December 2014, a one-year tax extension of the federal production tax credits for wind power through the end of 2014. As a result of this, wind energy 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 projects that begin construction until January 1st 2015 qualify for 10 years of PTCs of $23/MWh on the electricity output. Previous to this extension, PTCs were available for wind energy projects that had begun construction until January 1st 2014. Wind projects also have the option to choose, in lieu of the PTC, 30% as investment tax credits of the project cost. This regulatory support is efficient, albeit visibility over the long-term extension of the incentives in place, PTCs mostly, is limited. It would be valuable to have at least a medium-term view on these deals, even if including a progressive phasing out, as it would allow for improved planning and better value for consumers. The situation as it is creates a volatile growth market as off-takers typically take the years when PTCs are available to sign new agreements. PTCs are currently crucial, but their relative importance is likely set to decrease over time. The economics of wind power in the U.S. are rapidly improving, necessitating lower and lower PPA prices, to the point where wind is competitive on its own in some areas against other traditional technologies, on a `new-build' basis. The various RPS and other environmental goals will still represent a substantial incentive, PTCs notwithstanding.  GROWTH PROSPECTS Even absent the PTCs extension, demand growth in the U.S. market could still be motivated by other existing forces, primarily the planned coal capacity retirements, wind energy competitiveness as well as RPS compliance in several states. Approximately 42 GW of coal capacity has been announced to retire through 2020 of which we expect wind to absorb a significant share in the replacement of such retirements. Furthermore, renewable energy generation becomes more competitive as a direct result from coal retirement. A higher penetration of energy generated from natural gas can lead to more flexible grids, benefitting intermittent resources such as renewables. Regarding RPS targets in place to encourage renewable energy demand, we estimate 22 GW of wind will need to be added until 2020 in order to fulfil compliance with targets already established. From wind energy competitiveness alone, we believe an additional 7 GW can be added. A pipeline of 19 GW is known to exist as assets under construction eligible under the previous PTC expiration in December 2013 to be installed in the period of 2014-16, and we estimate some additional 14 GW may be added until 2020 from further PTC extensions, of which 6 GW from the last PTC expiration in December 2014, according to MAKE Consulting.

However, it will expectably see its installed base almost quintupling by 2020. The expected growth will be driven by the following key factors: - large power generation capacity needs, due to fast growth in electricity consumption and increasing concern over potential chronic hydropower shortfalls (e.g. droughts) as hydro represents c. 60% of the region's output; - excellent wind resource, translated into best-in-class load factors, even higher than North America on average, therefore providing relatively low cost wind energy; - low current penetration, with only just 0.5% of total electricity derived from wind; - limited access to cheap gas, with expensive imports helping the relative competitiveness of wind vs CCGTs; - growing regulatory support, mostly through organized tenders and preferable financing. The region is also a natural extension of the accelerating development that has been seen in the U.S. over recent years, given it is already a key market for large integrated European utilities (conventional generation and distribution, mostly). Brazil and Mexico are the main emerging wind hubs in the area. The regulation and remuneration of wind energy is a diverse mix of national schemes: · In Brazil, regulation initially focused on the PROINFA framework, established in 2002, which set a target in terms of capacity additions, with the selected projects getting a 20-year PPA with Eletrobras as off-taker, at a price defined by the government. The policy then evolved to embrace competitive but regulated auctions, with long-term PPAs reserved for wind only. Some preferential financing is provided by Brazilian development agencies and tariff incentives are put in place for some end-users to contract wind energy directly. Since 2009, new laws, including incentives for the establishment of local supply chains, gradually allowed wind to compete against other technologies, including thermal, through regulated auctions. The winning projects secure longterm PPAs with distribution companies. This new round of regulation is widely credited with being responsible for the recent take-off in Brazilian wind. · In Mexico there are no large-scale incentives or feed-in tariffs, but some tax incentives as the assets are allowed to be fully depreciated in their first year of operation. The current system is similar to the U.S. framework, and relies on bilateral PPAs between independent power producers and off-takers, typically over 15-20 years. At the end of 2013, the authorities of the country started a reform process to end the historical power monopoly and move closer to a liberalised energy market. This is also an opportunity for a new framework for wind remuneration, along with other needed reforms (such as the unbundling of the transmission system operator and the setting up of an independent regulator). Currently, the government now targets 10 GW to be installed by 2022 and 2 GW additions per year.       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       42 40  EDPR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR ·· 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  MOVING TOWARDS MARKET AUCTION-BASED ARRANGEMENTS One key feature of wind energy is the ability it affords to secure some visibility on the top line from its predictable and stable load factors over the long-run. Yet given that wind is a very capital-intensive technology, ensuring a guaranteed revenue stream is key to achieve a risk/return balance and allow value creation. There are differences in remunerations based on administratively set incentives (feed-in tariffs, green certificates, production tax credits) and market-based remunerations involving a certain degree of competition ex-ante (power purchase agreements, auctions). The following table summarizes the type of remuneration framework for wind and solar energy in key markets of EDPR:  Country Type of remuneration US Spain France Poland Italy UK Brazil Mexico PPAs + PTCs + RECs Pool + incentives Feed-in tariff  Comments Possibility of using Investment Tax Credits instead of PTCs Recently switched from centralised feed-in-tariff Recently held auctions for several offshore concessions  Portugal Feed-in tariff Belgium Pool + green certificates Pool + green certificates To introduce a new framework based on auctions by 2016 Auctions Pool + incentives Auctions PPAs Recently switched from green certificates to competitive tenders To switch to auctions by 2017 To switch to auctions by 2013 Romania Pool + green certificates  Germany Feed-in tariff  Given the growing affordability concern about renewables to consumers, and recent cuts in remuneration, there is a shift towards market auction-based systems. This different regulatory framework can still achieve the needed renewable capacity additions that is an all-round best solution for the energy system as a whole and, in the end, to the consumer that benefits from lower energy bills, in part due to the lower risk that this system represents to the energy companies that allow to bid lower prices. This shift is already evident with the number of countries turning to public competitive bidding or tendering auctions rising from 9 in 2009 to 55 as of early 2014. The mechanism is already well developed in the Americas but not so much in Europe, where various schemes are in place in different countries, often based on feed-in tariff systems (e.g. Spain, Portugal, France) which were very effective in driving initial investments during the infancy phase of the technology, and contributing to a higher penetration of renewables. A market auction-based system, the like of bilateral PPAs or public tenders: - provides visibility (normally between 15 to 25 years) to the energy companies, making cash-flows and returns more secure, and attracting the required investment of very high front-loaded capital costs; - limits the regulatory risks as no centralised scheme is needed (of national feed-in tariff for example), and can still be flexibly combined with various incentives (such as PTCs); - allows ex-ante competition favouring the most efficient technologies and the most valuable projects, and sends price signals to the sector, while preventing under or over-remuneration of the assets. A strong element in favour of market auction-based systems is those are a highly adaptable structure, with all variables getting embedded in the bid prices and the most competitive bids are awarded the contracts or the capacities. Prices determined this competitively reflect the quality of the local wind resource.

SPAIN NEW REGULATION: The remuneration for the renewable energy assets is now structured so that over the regulatory life, which is 20 years for wind energy assets, the standard asset receives a pre-tax return defined as the yield of the Spanish 10-year bonds plus 300 basis points. In broad terms, under the new remuneration scheme, wind energy assets commissioned up to 2003 sell its output at the market pool price and in addition receives an annual capacity complement. The amount of complement per MW is set to achieve the designed target return over the 20-years regulatory life for standard wind energy assets, meaning assets with average operating parameters (for example load factor, capex, opex, etc). The framework also considers a mechanism of caps and floors in order to adjust for deviations from the market pool price reference. For 2014, the regulation sets the pool price reference at  48.2 per MWh, creating a collar limiting the range of possible prices to be earned between  42.2 and 54.2 per MWh as depicted in the chart. Wind energy assets commissioned until 2003 are not entitled to capacity complement, as those wind farms are expected to reach the designed target return through selling its production at the market pool price alone. The new framework was announced in 2013 through the Royal DecreeLaw 9 in July and included in the Law 24 in December. This regulatory modification is effective from July 12th 2013. In June 2014, the Spanish government published, in its Order IET/1045, the parameters for renewable energy assets under the new remuneration framework, approved the year before. 59 55 Realised price 51 47 43 39  /MWh  EXPECTED EBITDA IMPACT IN AN AVERAGE YEAR FOR EDPR: This regulatory change is calculated to negatively impact EBITDA by around  30 million in an average year of wind energy electricity output for EDPR, when compared to the previous framework (RDL 2/2013) which provided a feed-in tariff regime.  36  40  44  48  52  56  60  Pool price  70 60 50 40 30 20 10  Spain pool price, /MWh and EDPR GWh in 2014  700 600 500 400 300 200 100  THE YEAR OF 2014: The average market pool price in 2014 was 41.8 per MWh thus in the lower limit of the interval provided by the abovementioned collar set in the new regulation. Furthermore, pool prices were lowest between January and April, when renewable energy output was at the highest in the year. In 2014 EDPR benefited from a higher output, when compared to the average production in a standard year. However this volume effect was more than offset by the low price effect and no hedging strategy in place. The new regulation parameters were only known during the second half of the year, which unfeasible the implementation of a hedging strategy for that period. For the reasons above, this new regulatory change ended up negatively impacting EDPR's EBITDA by more than the normally expected  30 million in an average year. This unfortunate exception, in the first year of the new regulation, will be naturally normalized with the risk management in place through the hedging approach described below.  RISK MANAGEMENT: Of the total 2.2 GW EBITDA consolidated by EDPR in Spain, only 9% is not entitled to capacity payment, corresponding to the capacity commissioned up to 2003. Of the total 5.1 TWh of electricity output by EDPR in an average year, about 20% is exclusively exposed to the market pool price, including not only the electricity output from the capacity without complement but also the premium production that EDPR consistently reaches in Spain. In order to manage the market pool price risk for the exposed production, EDPR employs a hedging policy to guarantee prices whenever those are considered reasonable. With this hedging strategy, EDPR removes the volatility of future revenues, which may vary negatively from a possible spike in overall renewable energy production, while the opposing upside scenario may not hold so effectively.

SELECTIVE GROWTH The company has a wide range of projects in its pipeline. Diverse investment options are crucial for ensuring the projects that are finally constructed have good strategic fit, meaning for EDPR a low risk profile at superior profitability. This is the case for the selective growth strategy as set up in its current Business Plan. For 2014-17 a growth target of +2 GW (>500 MW/year) has been set, in projects to share those two key guidelines: 1) A low risk profile through high visibility over future cash-flows, with most of the new capacity to be constructed under long-term PPAs already awarded or available regulated feed-in tariffs. This greatly allows to lock-in the project profitability. 2) High operational performance, with the projects identified to be built at above portfolio average operating metrics, namely in terms of load factors. This contributes to reduce the burden on remuneration. ^2.0 [CAT EGO US RY 60% NAM E] [PER CENT AGE] Euro pe [PER Europe CENT 20% AGE]  ^1.5  ^1.0  EDPR to deliver >500MW/year in high quality projects: 60% in US, 20% in Europe and 20% from emerging markets  ^0.5 2014 2015 2016 2017 Emerging Emerging makets markets [PERCENTAGE] 20%  60% GROWTH FROM US, DRIVEN BY PPAS ALREADY SIGNED Following a period of low growth in the United States, this market has been again chosen as the main growth driver for the company over the next four years period.

Additionally, self-funding is available, through the availability of tax equity partnerships with the possibility of asset rotation transactions as well, given the strong interest from infrastructure and pension funds for equity stakes. Project economics on all of the new investments in the US are strong, with average load factors of about 43%, earning average PPA prices in the first year of $48/MWh, leading to double-digit IRR percentages.  20% GROWTH FROM EUROPE, FOCUSING ON LOW RISK FRAMEWORKS Certain European markets continue to provide good growth opportunities supported by regulatory frameworks that provide a low risk environment. In France, EDPR maintains 60-70 MW of projects under development in its pipeline to be available for construction and benefit from the existing feed-in tariff regime. In Italy, EDPR will build the 30 MW awarded in 2013, and participate in future energy auctions to generate new possible additions for 2015-17. In Poland, further growth is contingent to the approval of a new energy law, expected to be based in energy auctions, where EDPR maintains competitive projects in pipeline. Finally, in Portugal, the total capacity awarded back in 2006 to the ENEOP consortium will be completed, and the consequent asset splitting expected in 2015, and by then EDPR will acquire the control and full consolidation of the MW corresponding to its 40% stake.  20% FROM SELECTED EMERGING MARKETS, IN PROJECTS WITH LONG-TERM PPAS In Brazil, EDPR will install in 2015-17 the projects with PPA awarded in 2011 and 2013 for a total 236 MW, thus representing a significant increase in capacity from current portfolio of 84 MW. In 2014 EDPR has entered the Mexican energy market signing a long-term electricity supply agreement, for the energy of a 180 MW wind farm to be installed in 2016, representing a sizeable entry in a low risk and attractive opening. Mexico is as a country with great potential for wind energy and this entry can provide a solid platform for further growth in this market. Additionally, EDPR is to remain actively prospecting opportunities in new markets with strong fundamentals, namely high growth of electricity demand, robust renewable resources and availability of long-term energy supply agreements awarded through competitive schemes.

INCREASED PROFITABILITY One of the strategic pillars and that has always been a keystone of the company, setting it apart in the industry, is the drive to maximize the operational performance of its wind farms and solar plants. In this area, EDPR's teams, namely in operations and maintenance, have established a strong track record that support challenging targets in 2014-17 Business Plan. For this period, EDPR has set targets in three key metrics: Availability (technical hourly availability), Load Factor and Opex/MW. These three metrics provide an overall view of the progress in our operations and maintenance, wind assessment and cost control efforts. They also serve as good indicators for the overall operational efficiency of the company.  As part of the 9% annualised increase target for EBITDA up to 2017, EDPR is implementing new technologies to improve the productivity of its wind farms, innovative O&M solutions and leaner approaches. MAINTAINING HIGH LEVELS OF AVAILABILITY >97.5% Availability measures the percentage of time the fleet is fully operational. If an equipment has a 97.5% availability metric this means that, in a given period, it was available to generate energy 97.5% of the time, which leaves only 2.5% for preventative maintenance or repairs. Availability is a clear indicator of performance of the company's operations and maintenance practices as it focuses on reducing to a minimum any malfunctions and performing maintenance activities in the shortest possible timeframe. The company always maintained high levels of availability, and registered above 97.5% in 2014, and has set a target of overcoming this already top mark in the period of 2014-17. EDPR will continue to look for further increases in availability through new predictive maintenance optimization measures supported by the 24/7 control and dispatch centre, in reducing damages most common during extreme weather and improving the scheduling of planned stops. Also a new spare parts warehousing strategy will be key in reducing downtime during unexpected repairs.  Availability >97.5%  LEVERAGING QUALITY GROWTH ON DISTINCTIVE WIND ASSESSMENT TOWARD 31.5% LOAD FACTOR Load factor (or net capacity factor) measures the speed and quality of the renewable resource at the wind turbines or solar panels. A load factor of 31.5% means the percentage of maximum theoretical energy output with an equipment working at full capacity, in a given period. For example, for 1 MW over a year, it equals to the production of 2,759.4 MWh (31.5% x 1 MW x 24 hours x 365 days). Ensuring the assets generate the maximum amount of energy possible is a key success factor. With regards to the operating portfolio, optimizing load factor is strongly linked to improving availability as described and, if possible, introducing productivity enhancement retrofits that boost production by setting older equipment models with the most up-to-date technological improvements available to increase efficiency in the utilization of renewable resources available. With regards to wind farms and solar plants under development, maximizing load factor is mostly the expert work of energy assessment and engineering teams, designing an optimal layout of the plant, by fitting the positioning and choice among different equipment models with the characteristics of the site, specially the terrain, from the collected resource measurements and their estimated energy outputs. The company has consistently maintained levels of load factor in the range of 29-30%, having registered 29.8% in 2014, which is slightly above the 29.4% P50 (mean probability) assessment for the current fleet, and has set a target of 31.5% until the end of the 2014-17 period.  29.4 %  31,5 %  Current P50  2017E       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       48 46  EDPR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR ·· 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  INCREASING EFFICIENCY, REDUCING OPEX/MW -2% In parallel with the top-line initiatives, the company focuses on strict cost control efforts to improve efficiency and gain additional profitability. Leveraging on the experience accumulated over time and its past performance (Opex/MW -5% CAGR 2010-2013), EDPR has set an ambitious to further reduce Opex/MW by -2% CAGR 20132017, despite the natural aging of its installed asset base. To achieve this target EDPR has developed a plan to tackle the main manageable costs in its costs structure. With regards to O&M, representing c. 30% of total Opex, EDPR expects to continue to obtain gains from its M3 system once wind farms are not subject to initial warranty contracts. With regards to SG&A and Personnel Costs, representing c. 50% of total Opex, the focus is to maintain a strict control plant to fully benefit from the economies of scale of a growing company. Levies, representing c. 20% of total Opex is basically non-manageable and increased in recent years, mostly penalised by the introduction of new taxes in some countries.  M3 PROGRAM AND SELF-PERFORMANCE As EDPR's fleet becomes more mature the initial Operations and Maintenance (O&M) contracts with the turbine suppliers expire. When that happens the company needs to decide between renewing the maintenance service and taking the risk and operate the wind farm on its own, whilst maintaining high levels of availability. The M3 (Modular Maintenance Model) program answers that question. Based on EDPR's expertise, our O&M teams will decide on the optimal balance between external contractors and in-house maintenance. Usually, EDPR keeps control of high value-added activities such as maintenance planning, logistics and remote operations while outsourcing, under direct supervision, people intensive tasks. This methodology resulted in estimated savings of around 20% in the wind farms where the M3 system was implemented, which account for 40% of Europe's fleet. On its turn, in the US the Blue Canyon V wind farm started its own pilot O&M program and is now fully operated by EDPR without any external help, immediately showing savings in operational expenses. Following this success other American plants will follow this model. An extraordinary example of the new efficiency achieved by the M3 program is the time needed to replace major components, which have being reduced from 5 months to 3 days. A new 2,000 square meter warehouse located in Castejón, Spain, is serving all the European countries.     INCREASING TURBINE PRODUCTION EDPR is also creating value by improving its assets implementing new technologies on the turbines to boost the power output without requiring major component changes. EDPR's Performance Analysis teams are collaborating with the manufacturers to determine the best practices to apply this new technology. By monitoring real-time conditions, the rotational speed of the generator can be increased while staying within the existing loads envelope, thus increasing the power output. The extra output increases the revenues of the wind farm, without major investments needed. This technology has successfully being applied on many turbines and it will keep being developed in the following years.  LEAN PROGRAM Launched in 2011, EDPR's Lean program focuses on optimizing process across the company's business using the lean six sigma methodology. The objective is to leverage front-line personnel ideas and experience to improve the company's revenues and costs, improve safety and reduce environmental impact. Within this strategy EDPR has implemented two programs, "Daily Lean" and "Lean improvement". The first, "Daily Lean" applies continuous improvement to the day-to-day activities at our wind farms, with the objective of reducing repetitive and non-value added tasks. The last, "Lean Improvement", developed by our performance engineers and our field personnel, identifies and solves issues that are common to a fleet of turbines or part of a fleet. This program implemented changes that help reduce the impact of lightning damage and reduce gearbox overheating, among others.

SELF-FUNDING MODEL First presented in the May 2012 Investor Day, EDPR's self-funding model has been one of the three supporting pillars of the company's strategy thereafter. This self-funding model excludes any increase in corporate debt, and therefore relies on the combination of cash-flow from operating assets, external funds from tax equity and other structured project finances as well as proceeds from asset rotation transactions to finance the profitable growth of the business.  OPERATING CASH-FLOW The primary source of funds for the company is the operating cash flow generated from the existing assets, which is firstly used to pay for the debt service and capital distributions to equity partners, while the excess is available to fund to pay dividends to the shareholders of EDPR or to fund new investments. Cash available for A strong operating cash-flow generation of about  3.5 billion is expected for the period 2014-17. Cash-flow available for dividends and new investments, of about  400 million in 2014, is expected to increase annually, on average, by about 20% until the end of the current business plan period in 2017. EDPR has indicated a dividend pay-out ratio policy in the range of 25-35% of its annual net profit, thus allowing that most of the cash-flow available to fund growth. The dividends paid in 2014 amounted to about  35 million corresponding to low end of the range relative to the net profit of the previous year, representing only a small share of the available cash-flow generated in the period. dividends and growth (bn)  c. +20% CAGR  ^0.4  2014  2017E  US TAX EQUITY AND OTHER PROJECT FINANCE STRUCTURES EDPR always aims to find external financing to its projects, namely through tax equity structures, typical of the US, and through other project finance structures, available in other geographies. The use of such structures fit in the self-funding model because they substitute the need of corporate debt. Moreover, the case of tax equity in the US also enables an efficient utilization of the tax benefits provided by the project thus improving its economics. In a simple view, under the tax equity partnerships, tax equity investors contribute a sizable part of the initial project investment, receiving in return almost all of the PTCs granted to the project for first ten years of operation. In the case of project finance, it is also a means to contract long-term debt in local currency at competitive costs in order to mitigate the refinancing risk and to reduce the foreign exchange risk by having a natural hedge between revenues and expenses. In 2014 EDPR closed three tax equity transactions relating to the total 329 MW capacity added in the US this year, and corresponding to tax equity financing proceeds of US$ 332 million (c. EUR 250 million). These transactions bring total tax equity financing proceeds ever raised by EDPR close to US$ 2.9 billion.

Such model enables the company to advance the value yet to be realized from the future cash-flows of its existing projects over their long remaining lifetime, and reinvest the corresponding proceeds in the development in additional new value accretive projects, with superior returns to the costs of the asset rotation proceeds themselves. These transactions involve the company selling minority stakes at the level of the projects (typically of 49%), and still maintaining full management control over these projects. Moreover, the scope of projects for these transactions tend to be mature projects, generally already operating and thus significantly de-risked, with a high quality in its future cash-flows, that can be attractive to low risk institutional investors from who EDPR can then source a competitive cost of finance.  FIRST ASSET ROTATION DEAL WAS SIGNED IN LATE 2012, AND SINCE THEN A TOTAL EIGHT TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN CLOSED, BRINGING THE TOTAL AMOUNT RAISED TO  1.2 BILLION.  In 2014, three transactions have been closed, involving assets located in three countries: the US, France and Canada, with different infrastructure funds as counterparties. Also at the end of the year, in the context of the ongoing strategic partnership between EDP and China Three Gorges, one additional transaction was signed, this time relating to wind farm wind farms and projects in Brazil.

RISK MANAGEMENT In line with EDPR's controlled risk profile, Risk Management process defines the mechanisms for evaluation and management of risks and opportunities impacting the business, increasing the likelihood of the company achieving its financial targets, while minimizing fluctuations of results without compromising returns. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS EDPR's Risk Management Process is an integrated and transversal management model that ensures the implementation of best practices of Corporate Governance and transparency in the communication to the market and shareholders. This process is closely followed and supervised by the Audit and Control Committee, an independent supervisory body composed of non-executive members. The purpose of the Risk Management process is to ensure the alignment of EDPR's risk exposure with the company's desired risk profile. It consists in the identification and prioritization of risks, the development of adequate risk management policies and their implementation. Risk management policies are aimed to mitigate risks, without ignoring potential opportunities, thus, optimizing return versus risk exposure. Risk management is endorsed by the Executive Committee, supported by the Risk Committee and implemented in day-to-day decisions by all managers of the company. It is supported by three distinct organizational functions, each one with a different role: Strategy (Risk Profiler), Management (Risk Manager) and Controlling (Risk Controller): · · · RISK PROFILER: Responsible for identification and analyses of risks, defining policies and limits for risk management within the company; RISK MANAGER: Responsible for day to day operational decisions and for implementing approved risk policies; RISK CONTROLLER: Responsible for follow up of the result of risk taking decisions and for verifying alignment of operations with general policy approved by the Executive Committee.  These three Risk Functions work together and meet in the Risk Committee, the forum to discuss global risk policies to be implemented and to control the risk exposure of the company. In order to separate business decisions from strategic analyses and the definition of new policies, EDPR created two distinct meetings of the Risk Committee with different periodicity: · RESTRICTED RISK COMMITTEE: Held every month, it reviews the risk of new transactions such as new power purchase agreements, new investments, energy price and FX hedges, along with pipeline status and EBITDA @Risk. It helps to control the implementation of defined policies and the exposure to most important risk factors. RISK COMMITTEE: Held every quarter, it is the forum where new strategic analyses are discussed and new policies are proposed for approval to the Executive Committee. Additionally, EDPR´s overall risk position is reviewed.  ·  RISK AREAS AND MAIN RISK FACTORS Risk Management at EDPR is focused on covering all market, credit and operational risks of the company. In order to have a holistic view of risks, they were grouped in Risk Areas covering the entire business cycle of EDPR. The following list summarizes Risk Areas defined within EDPR: · · · · · · COUNTRIES & REGULATIONS: Changes in regulations may impact EDPR's business in a given country; REVENUES: Revenues received by EDPR's projects may diverge from what is expected; FINANCING: EDPR may not be able to raise enough cash to finance its planned Capex; or to fulfil its financial obligations due to changes in exchange rates or bankruptcy of counterparties; WIND TURBINE CONTRACTS: Changes in turbine prices may impact projects' profitability; or there may not be sufficient turbine supply to build planned wind farms; PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT: EDPR may deliver an installed capacity different from its targets or suffer delays and/or anticipations in its installation; OPERATIONS: Projects may deliver a volume different from expected due to turbine availability; financial results can be impacted by human errors.  Within each Risk Area, risks are classified in Risk Groups and finally into Risk Factors. Those are the source of the risk and the purpose of Risk Management at EDPR is to measure, control and eventually mitigate all risk factors that affect the company. The following table summarizes the Risk Areas, Risk Groups and main Risk Factors of the company's business and the Risk Management mitigation strategies, general and specific to the year 2014.

In addition to the first solar project installed in the U.S., in 2014 EDPR also installed its first solar project in Portugal of 2 MW. All in all, Portugal installed 82 MW (78 MW ENEOP + 2 MW Solar + 2 MW Wind overpowering). In Poland, EDPR continues to see positive growth with the installation of 22 MW, 18 MW from the Radziejów wind farm located in the central region and 4 MW from Ilza, which brings that project's total capacity to 54 MW. EDPR added 18 MW to its installed capacity in France with the completion of the Truc de l'Homme wind farm of 12 MW and 6 MW from the Preuseville project. Truc de l'Homme presented numerous developmental challenges that were eventually overcome. Preuseville is an extension of an existing wind farm in north-west France.    After success in the 2014 auctions in Italy, EDPR was able to deliver on 20 MW with the San Giovanni project.

NEARLY 90% OF 2015 EXPECTED CAPACITY ADDITIONS ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION By the end of 2014, EDPR had over 443 MW under construction all related to projects to be delivered in 2015. In the U.S., EDPR had 299 MW under construction related to two wind farms with PPAs already secured, Waverly (200 MW in Kansas) and Rising Tree South (99 MW in California). In addition to the capacity already under construction, during 2015 EDPR will also start construction on the Arbuckle wind farm (100 MW in Oklahoma, US), which has a secured PPA. Although no new capacity was added during the year in Brazil, EDPR has 120 MW under construction, related to the Baixa do Feijão projects after successfully bidding in the A5 auction for 20 year PPAs schedule to start in 2016. In Europe, 24 MW were under construction: 10 MW in Italy, 6 MW in Portugal, 6 MW in Poland and 2 MW in Spain related to a turbine prototype.  88% OF EDPR'S INSTALLED CAPACITY IS COVERED BY ISO 14001 CERTIFICATION The Environmental Management System (EMS) is developed in accordance with the ISO 14001 international standard and certified by an independent certifying organization. These consensus standards are considered the world's benchmark for EMS Management Systems and is a guarantee that EDPR sites, regardless of its regulatory environment are aligned and at the same level of compliance. Assets' Average Age & Useful Life In addition to operating high quality and safe assets, Assets' Average Age & Useful Life 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 EDPR also has a young portfolio with an average 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 operating age of 5 years, with an estimate of at least Spain 6.8 20 years of useful life remaining to be captured. In Europe, EDPR's portfolio had an average age of 5 years, in North America 5 years, and in Brazil 4 years. Throughout the entire process, from development to operations, EDPR maintains the highest standards in construction quality, integrity, and sustainability. Considerable efforts were conducted to restore the land and biodiversity to either its original state or an improved state, for example by removing hazardous wastes uncovered during construction in California or burying high voltage lines underground to diminish visual impact. During the construction of the solar plants in the U.S., nearly 35 acres of conservation lands for preserving habitat for desert species were created. In Indiana, over 120 kilometres of public county roads were maintained and nearly half of those were strengthened. 6.8 Spain Portugal 5.6 5.6 Portugal France 5.2 5.2 France Belgium 4.9 4.9 Belgium Poland 2.5 Poland 2.5 Romania 2.4 Romania 2.4 Italy 1.2 1.2 Italy US 4.9 4.9 US Canada 1.0 [VALUE].0 Canada Brazil 3.9 3.9 Brazil EDPR 5.2 EDPR 5.2  However, environmental sustainability is not the only concern. In Italy, an archaeological area was found by the archaeological surveillance team resulting in a very deep campaign to discover and catalogue all the archaeological findings and protect them against the earthworks to be performed. Similarly in California, palaeontologists sifted through over 100 cubic yards of soil in an area of potential significance and all finds will be curated in a museum. All in all, the total value created by the installation of nearly 0.5 GW is greatly positive.

When adding the over 1 TWh produced from our equity projects, enough clean energy was produced to serve nearly 50% of the electricity demand of Portugal. The 3% year over year increase in the electricity output benefited from the capacity additions over the last 12 months and the strong wind resource in North America throughout 2014. EDPR achieved a 30% load factor during 2014, which is in line with last year, maintaining its leading position within the wind sector and reflecting the intrinsic quality of the wind farms. EDPR also achieved a stellar 98% availability. EDPR continues to leverage on its competitive advantages to maximize wind farm output and on its diversified portfolio to mitigate the wind volatility risk.

This performance was driven by EDPR's unique ability to capture the strong wind resource available and the contribution from new additions. EDPR achieved a 33% load factor in North America, +1pp vs. 2013, further reflecting the high quality assets. Production growth in Europe was mainly due to reaping the benefits from the installed capacity in 2013, which help offset the decline in year over year load factor. All countries deliver positive growth except for Spain where 2013 was considered an above average year.  EDPR 30%  EDPR 30%  EU 28%  EU 27%  Iberia delivered a 28% load factor (vs. 29% in 2013), although a decline YoY, the efficiency achieved was above normal expectations and 2013 was an exceptional year for Spain. Moreover, EDPR delivered once again a solid premium over the Spanish market average load factor (+2pp). FY13 FY14  The Rest of Europe operations delivered a 24% load factor (25% in 2013) and posted higher year over year generation. Poland increased its production by 253 GWh as new capacity and a solid resource contributed to the strong performance. Higher production in Italy was mainly due to a full year of operations for capacity installed in 2013. The remaining countries delivered stable growth of 28 GWh. In 2014, EDPR's output in Brazil increased 3% YoY to 236 GWh, as a result of a higher wind resource during the year, and led to a higher load factor of 32%. The Tramandaí wind farm continues to deliver above average load factors.  CARBON FREE EMISSIONS The 19.8 TWh of electricity produced has zero carbon emissions, thus contributing to the world's fight against climate change. Based on each countries' thermal emission factors, an estimate of 17 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions were avoided that would have otherwise been emitted by burning fossil fuels to generate the same amount of electricity in the geographies where EDPR is present.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVENUES TOTALLED 1.3 BILLION EUROS AND EBITDA SUMMED 903 MILLION EUROS In 2014, EDPR revenues totalled 1,277 million euros, a decrease of 40 million euros when compared to 2013 mainly driven by the lower selling price but mitigated by the 3% output increase. EDPR's average selling price decreased 6% as the result of the lower average selling price in Europe and partially offset by the higher average selling price in North America and Brazil. In Europe, revenues evolution was mainly impacted by EDPR operations in Spain, following the change in assets remuneration framework with the approval of RDL 413/2014 in June 2014 in addition to the unfavourable pool prices, and minimized by EDPR's younger assets and load factor. EBITDA decreased 17 million euros year on year to 903 million euros, as a result of the top-line evolution and partially offset by lower net operating costs. EBITDA margin increased from 70% to 71%, demonstrating EDPR control over costs and strong efficiency levels.

ROBUST CASH-FLOW Operating Cash-Flow increased 4% to 707 million euros, higher than the net investments of the period. In 2014, EDPR received 215 million euros related to the financial closing of the asset rotation transactions signed in October 2013 with Axpo Group, and in October and November 2014 with EFG Hermes and Northleaf respectively. In August 2014, EDPR structured an additional asset rotation transaction with Fiera Axium for a portfolio of wind farms in the United States, which final financial close is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, in 2014, a cash grant of 22 million euro was collected in Poland. Capital expenditures (Capex) totalled 732 million euros reflecting the capacity additions in the year and the capacity under construction, leading to Net Investments of 515 million euro. As a result of forex translation (impact 170 million euros), investments done in the period, robust cash-flow generation, the execution of the asset rotation strategy and close monitoring of operating costs, Net Debt increase by 14 million euros.

The impact in the average selling price is mainly driven by changes in Spanish remuneration for renewable assets and negatively magnified by the low market price in the period. Other operating income increased by 4 million euros, while Operational expenses (Opex) ­ defined as Operating costs excluding Other operating income - decreased by 18 million euros, leading to a 8% decrease in the Opex per average MW. Excluding levies and write-offs, Opex per average MW decreased by 6% and Opex per MWh by 5%, showing strict control over costs and strong efficiency levels. Impacted by the top line, EBITDA decreased 2% to 903 million euros, while EBITDA margin improved to 71% versus 70% in 2013. Operating income (EBIT) summed 422 million euros, reflecting the 8% higher depreciation and amortisation costs. In 2014, impairments had an impact of 27 million euros in EBIT, mainly as a consequence of a new longterm scenario with more conservative assumptions for EDPR operations in Romania. At the financing level, Net Financial Expenses decreased 5%. Net interest costs increased 3% due to higher average net debt (+123 million euros versus previous year) along with a stable 5.2% cost of debt. Institutional Partnership costs in 2014 were 7% lower, while capitalised expenses increased by 11 million euros. Forex differences and derivatives had a negative impact of 5 million euros, as the positive impact from Leu was offset by the US dollar appreciation and Zloty depreciation. Share of profits of associates increased by 7 million euros to 22 million euros, mainly reflecting EDPR's interest in ENEOP, the positive performance of United States associate companies and a Purchase Price Allocation post the acquisition of a company in Mexico, offsetting the negative performance of Spanish associate companies. Pre-Tax Profit amounted to 194 million euros and income taxes decreased to 16 million euros, due to the positive effect of the approved corporate tax reform in Spain (income tax will be reduced to 25% in 2016 and beyond) impacting deferred assets and liabilities. Non-controlling interests in the period totalled 52 million euros, an increase of 18 million euros on the back of the non-controlling interests sold to CTG in the context of the EDP strategic partnership, to Fiera Axium, Axpo Group, EFG Hermes and Northleaf as part of the execution of the asset rotation strategy.

The increased equity attributable to the shareholders of EDPR by 111 million euros is mainly a result of the 126 million euros of Net Profit, reduced by the 35 million euros in dividend payments. Total liabilities increased 15% by +1,017 million euros, mainly in accounts payable (+549 million euros), financial debt (+236 million euros) and institutional partnerships (+231 million euros). With total liabilities of 8.0 billion euros, the debt-to-equity ratio of EDPR stood at 126% by the end of 2014, which is an increase from the 114% in 2013. Liabilities were mainly composed of financial debt (49%), liabilities related to institutional partnerships in the US (13%) and accounts payable (24%). Liabilities to tax equity partnerships in the US stood at 1,067 million euros, and including +217 million euros of new tax equity proceeds received in the 2014. Deferred revenues related to institutional partnerships primarily represent the non-economic liability associated to the tax credits already realized by the institutional investor, arising from accelerated tax depreciation, and yet to be recognized as income by EDPR throughout the remaining useful lifetime of the respective assets. Deferred tax liabilities reflect the liabilities arising from temporary differences between the accounting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Accounts payables include trade suppliers, PP&E suppliers, deferred income related to investment grants received and derivative financial instruments. As total assets totalled 14.3 billion euros in 2014, the equity ratio of EDPR reached 44%, versus 47% in 2013. Assets were 77% composed of net PP&E - property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cumulative net invested capital in renewable energy generation assets. Total net PP&E of 11.0 billion euros changed to reflect 749 million euros of new additions during the year of and 630 million euros from forex translation (mainly as the result of a US Dollar appreciation), and reduced by 487 million euros for depreciation charges, impairment losses and write-offs. Net intangible assets mainly include 1.4 billion euros from goodwill registered in the books, for the most part related to acquisitions in the US and Spain, while accounts receivable are mainly related to loans to related parties, trade receivables, guarantees and tax receivables.

In detail, the decrease in revenues was a result of lower revenues in Spain (-93 million euros), mitigated by the increase in revenues in Portugal (+5 million euros) and Rest of Europe (+16 million euros). Consequently, the contribution from Spain decreased from 53% to 46%, while contribution from Portugal and Rest of Europe increased from 20% to 22% and 27% to 31%, respectively. 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014  Revenues (m) 778 635  820  747  562  AVERAGE SELLING PRICE The average selling price in Europe decreased 10% to 80 euros per MWh, mainly driven by Spanish changes in the remuneration framework for renewable assets, and in Rest of Europe by the lower realised price in Romania, with green certificates being sold at the floor of the regulated collar.  NET OPERATING COSTS Net Operating Costs decreased 12% year on year, to 202 million euros, as a results of 12 million euros decrease in Operating costs and a 15 million euros increase in Other operating income, mainly due to a price adjustment in the sale of Portuguese assets to CTG following lower corporate taxes in Portugal.

Selling prices for the production exposed to wholesale electricity prices also went up, from 32 US Dollars per MWh in 2013 to 41 US Dollars per MWh, benefiting from higher gas prices, due to low gas inventories and unusually cold winter in the first months of 2014, and an increase in REC prices.  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  NET OPERATING COSTS Net Operating Costs increased 2% to 194 million US Dollars, mainly due to the lower Other operating income that offset the decrease in operating costs. The decrease in other operating income reflects the 18 million US Dollars from the restructuring of the off-taking volumes of a PPA for 200 MW in 2013. A strict control over costs and high efficiency levels resulted in 7% decrease in Opex per MW, to 61 thousand US Dollars.  INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND GOVERNMENT GRANTS Income from Institutional Partnerships totalled 164 million US Dollars. The projects that opted for the cash grant benefited from lower depreciation charges, booked in the income statement as amortisation of government grants, totalling 23 million US Dollars.

ENVIRONMENT 3.2.1. ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT EDPR is a leading company in renewable energy. We produce clean and green energy, energy without emissions. Our strategy towards the environment is based on four pillars: the generation of CO2-free and water-free energy, minimization of environmental impacts during the life-cycle of our wind farms, respect for the biodiversity and a culture of responsibility and recycling. Even though we are in a clean energy business, we go beyond our commitment with the environment by fostering a corporate culture in which initiatives and activities are consistent with environmental responsibility. Therefore we are committed to minimize the environmental impact of our operations and measure the footprint from our administrative activities and plants electricity consumption, representing 0.2% of the emissions avoided. Despite this low impact we encourage reducing these emissions by improving our practices. EDPR's small footprint regarding CO2 emissions and water is due to administrative activities and plants electricity consumption.

BIODIVERSITY In the long term, EDPR aims to contribute to an overall positive balance to the world's objective of reducing biodiversity loss due to human activity, one of today's greatest challenge. In an effort to seek a positive balance in biodiversity, numerous initiative were performed in 2014: measure is to prevent problems arising from erosion as well as improving the landscape integration. Since 2013 and until late 2014, the actions that have been made, were plantations and hydro-seeding, slopes restructuring and drainage structures improvement. Furthermore, aged rock slope labors were carried out for optimal integration. After completion of each performance, environmental technicians along with the companies in charge of the environmental monitoring, keep tracking the evolution. So far, 16.2 hectares have been hydro-seeded, 24,215 units were planted and 2.83 hectares have been integrated in landscape. Results to date are satisfactory and the development of more planned measures are expected for 2015.  IBERIAN WOLF The Iberian wolf is a species subject to particular attention as stated in the specific legislation for the protection and preservation of its habitat. It is estimated that there are nearly 300 specimens of Iberian wolf in Portugal whose habitat extends from the district of Viseu to the north of the country. EDPR has several wind farms in this area, which have been developed with the contribution of specialists in Iberian wolf. Tracking programs were established in the most sensible areas, as well as mitigation and compensation measures for this species and its habitat. Many of these measures are intended to reduce the conflict between the local population and the Iberian wolf, trying to direct the wolf towards the wild prey species existing in their habitat.  GOLDEN EAGLE STUDY The golden eagle population status largely affects the manner by which EDPR develops and operates its wind projects in adherence with the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Action (BGEPA). EDPR has contributed funding to the Oregon Eagle Foundation (OEF) and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to conduct state-specific efforts to understand population status of eagles in those states. Thus far, OEF has completed four years of surveys, and WDFW has completed two years. Results of these surveys are forthcoming, but initial results do not indicate that Washington and Oregon eagle populations are in large decline.  RAINWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS In 2014, as part of one of its environmental targets within environmental management system, EDPR has conducted a series of implementations of rainwater uptake systems in several Spanish substations. The main objective is to reduce water consumption from other less sustainable sources in such a way that, taking advantage of rainwater, good environmental practice is done and a trend towards a self-sufficiency model is performed. Before the establishment of the target, there were already 14 installations using this system and, from the implementation to date, rainwater systems have been installed in further 17 substations. As a result of this measure, today 53% of the water consumed in Spain is rainwater origin. During 2015 it is expected this system to be installed in another 5 substations, so that almost 80% of Spanish installations would benefit from this supply. Additionally, this type of systems were implemented in other European geographies, 65% of the water used in Portugal and 100% in Belgium is rainwater collected.  BAT CURTAILMENT STORY Direct mortality at wind turbines is currently the greatest concern for bats in general at wind facilities EDPR has instituted a conservation program that incorporates feathering* operational wind turbines below the manufacturer's operational cut-in speed from ½ hour before sunset to ½ hour after sunrise during the fall migration period (August 1st to October 15th). Starting in 2014, seven of EDPR's wind facilities fully feathered all wind turbines below the manufacturer's operational cut-in speed for the fall migration season. EDPR will continue to implement this conservation plan in future years and will enhance the functionality at many sites for the 2015 season.  ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION EDPR has launched an environmental restoration program in several Spanish facilities.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT EDPR is strongly committed to contribute to the protection of the environment and biodiversity through a proactive environmental management of its wind farms in operation, as is stated in our Environmental and Biodiversity policies (detailed information available at www.edpr.com). The operation stage of wind farms, with a useful life of 25 years, stands as the core of our business. According to this, we are conscious of the importance of proper management of environmental matters in our facilities in operation, which is assured through the Environmental Management System (EMS).  WHAT IS THE EMS? EDPR's Environmental Management System (EMS) is a framework that helps the company achieve its environmental goals through consistent control of its operations, applicable to operations and maintenance phase of wind farms and solar PV plants, with the aim of improving its environmental performance. The system ensures focus on relevant environmental aspects, compliance with legal requirements while setting environmental objectives and targets to improve our environmental performance at country and platform levels.  HOW DOES THE EMS PROCESS WORK? The implementation efforts of EDPR EMS started in 2008. All this is sustained by a continual improvement of the environmental performance mind-set and a qualified team aligned with the environmental strategy of the company. Both, our environment specialists and the network of external partners working with us, stand out for their extensive professional experience and knowledge of the environmental field.  Potential Environmental Aspects Corporate Policy Risk Assessment Legal Requirements Objectives and targets program  CONTROL, MONITORING AND AUDIT  HOW IS THE EMS CERTIFIED?

Since the beginning of the project in 2011, the School has already reached 804 employees of EDPR in all the geographies.  PROMOTIONS & MOBILITY All our employees are covered by our performance evaluation system that collects information from several data sources to evaluate employee performance. In the context of fostering workers' growth through diversity of experience, EDPR encourages professional mobility. To support the global growth strategy, mobility is of upmost importance as a powerful tool to share EDPR culture and best practices with new markets where we plan to enter. During 2014, 73 employees had functional or geographical mobility including 8 new expatriates (expats). EDPR now has a total of 23 expats.  COMMUNICATION EDPR is committed to provide employees with the best workplace experience. To help determine key drivers of employee satisfaction, EDPR ran a survey in 2013 to collect, analyse and act upon the results. After holding workshops to further discuss the results, an Action Plan was created to improve satisfaction during 2014. The plan was primarily focused on improving communication within the company. It is important to have open lines of communications with employees so in order to improve the channels, different measures were implemented: · Meetings with the CEO: During these meetings, employees are given the opportunity to share their point of view of the business from their positions and learn about the strategy of the company and how this relates to their day-to-day tasks. This is a great opportunity for employees to better understand their impact on the business. Almost 85% of our employees already had the chance to meet the CEO. · Meetings with HR: EDPR is keen on connecting with employees. HR regularly holds organized meetings with a small group of employees to discuss important issues via an open forum. Almost 85% of the employees have participated. · HR Monthly: EDPR employees receive a monthly newsletter with human resources related news. The publication includes upcoming events, training and volunteering opportunities, social benefits, information on new hires, ongoing recruitments, and is an important tool to share the social initiatives with the employees. In addition to open communication channels established for employees, satisfaction surveys are conducted every two years to gather opinions and gain an understanding of the motivation and satisfaction level of employees. The participation rate in the last survey reached 95% with a satisfaction score of 77%. During 2014, the Great Place to Work (GPTW) organization named EDP Renewables in Poland the best place to work. EDPR also continued to be among the 50 best companies to work for in the GPTW Rankings in Spain and the UK. EDPR's ability to attract, develop, and retain talent is a testament to its commitment to excelling in all areas. It's no wonder that EDPR continues to be among the 50 best companies to work for as determined by the Great Place to Work rankings. A motivated workforce aligned with the company's strategy is one of the key drivers behind our ability to deliver on results during 2014.

The programme was attended by 3,862 students in Albacete province. · In the environmental area Fundación EDP has been supporting, among others, two sounding projects carried out by the University of Málaga and by Fundación del Patrimonio Natural de Castilla y León, respectively. In both cases the programmes are studying and implement actions to protect several species of birds of prey. · And in the social area EDPR together with Fundación EDP has supported several initiatives, some developed internally such as the volunteering programmes or the interrelation with the community activities, and many others developed by third parties such as Fundación Sociedad, Educación y Desarrollo, several food banks or Fundación Cerro Verde. EDPR has devoted more than 0.5 million euros in 2014 to support the activities of Fundación EDP. For 2015 EDPR will keep supporting the activities of Fundación EDP, including the new social programme called "EDP Solidaria 2015" to contribute to improve the quality of life and the integration of social disadvantaged people. Details of these activities can be obtained in the web page of Fundación EDP (www.fundacionedp.es). EDPR devotes time and resources to local communities in all countries in which it operates. Therefore, and in line with EDP Foundation's strategy, its activities are focused on three pillars: education, social and environment. EDPR has several modalities of collaboration with communities, initiatives that only involve the company, others in which it does it along with their employees and others in which are EDPR employees who dedicate their resources or time to these activities. Thereby, EDPR shows that is a company concerned about one of its key stakeholders both at organizational and individual level.  SOLIDARITY TEAMBUILDING In 2014, taking the opportunity that most of the employees in Europe were together in Madrid in order to assist to the Annual Meeting, a team-building event took place December 2014. 600 employees were challenged to spend one full morning assembling a large variety of furniture that EDPR then distributed to several Spanish non-profit organizations.

The importance of sustainability in the supply chain is a key thing for EDPR. EDPR's Code of Ethics defines the core values that must be respected and the framework of the relationship with suppliers. Moreover, our Health & Safety and our Environmental Management Systems require our employees and all other individuals working on behalf of EDPR to follow a series of best practices in those areas, as required in our Environmental and H&S Policy. EDPR Procurement Manual includes a chapter that guides each Purchasing Department to put our values and principles into practice, therefore when procuring and contracting goods and services EDPR appeals to all reasonable endeavours so that selected suppliers accept to comply with the UN Global Compact's ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption and the spirit of EDPR's Code of Ethics. Additionally, EDPR collects sustainability information for the main services provider to be used in the supplier's selection. In Europe, this is made by an independent partner and in the US by internal questionnaires. In 2014, about 67% of EDPR's suppliers in Corporate and Europe had Occupation Health & Safety system and 74% Environmental system. In North America, 25% and 65% of the companies have environmental and health and safety management systems, respectively. · · · ·  Certified suppliers Certified suppliers 67% 67% 74% 74% 65% 65%  25% 25%  Europe & Corporate Europe & Corporate  North America North America  Environmental system or equivalents Occupational H&S system or equivalents Occupational H&S system or equivalents Environmental system or equivalents Europe includes suppliers above 500k euros; Europe includes suppliers above 500k euros; North America started capturing North America started capturing Sustainability data as part of the supplier Sustainability 2014; qualification indata as part of the supplier qualification in 2014; North America figures consider Biodiversity North America figures consider Biodiversity programs as Environmental Management programs System. as Environmental Management System.  SUPPLY CHAIN DEVELOPMENT IN THE UK The development of offshore wind energy brings significant new markets and opportunities to Scotland and the UK. As a developing industry, offshore wind requires the development of new enterprises and diversification of existing enterprise to undertake the works associated with the deployment of infrastructure. MORL a joint venture between EDPR and Repsol Nuevas Energias UK has worked with a variety of agencies to enable businesses local to the Moray Firth, Scotland and the UK to take advantage of the new offshore wind market. As result of this work, new companies were created and also spurred the establishment of new joint ventures with broad-ranging capabilities. Since 2012 MORL's competitive tender process has driven the development of 7- 8MW turbines suitable for deeper water, high wind sites which are capable of reducing the cost of energy. Where monopoles have been the industry standard in the past, MORL is driving competition between next generation substructures. Successful deployment will support the evolution of the industry, establishing the standard for the rest of R3 and opening new areas of seabed worldwide to development. Additionally, MORL has identified partners in both the public and private sector to identify the skills gap and develop strategies to fill it. Resolving the skills gap has already yielded benefits beyond the UK market. Skills which were established developing MORL's projects were successfully exported to France where EDPR won both sites of the French Round 2 tender.  · ·       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15        EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014 MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  77 75  3.4. INNOVATION Innovation is about new technologies for more renewable energy - such as offshore wind - but that is not all: it is also about attitude, looking for ongoing improvement every day at what we do.  INNOVATION IN DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OPTIMIZATION OF WIND FARM LAYOUT AND CONSTRUCTION During the construction of a wind farm, finding the optimal design for wind farm foundations is critical to control capex requests. Optimal superficial foundations are those that minimize the volume for the specific conditions of the site, while ensuring all applicable safety requirements. However, in the case of deep foundations (piloted ones), finding the optimal solution is more complex as it is a process of optimizing a number of different variables: shape of the foundation and the number, diameter, type and length of the piles. EDPR internally developed an algorithm to obtain the optimal design piloted foundation for a wind farm project once known the wind turbine weight and the geotechnical information of the site. WIND FARM OPTIMIZATION MODEL After three years of work, the Department of Energy Assessment EDPR created the edpWOM (Windfarm Optimization Model) program. It is a specific software for estimating annual energy production and optimization of layout adapted to the particularities of the company. This program has been the reference tool in the project offshore Moray Firth. The programming environment allows simulations automatically and in a reduced period of time compared to other commercially available software. One of its strengths is that being a code generated internally, supports any modification or addition of new criteria according to the needs of the project at the time, without modelling the data again as with the other standard software marketed. It is able to optimize according to different adaptable and independent criteria according to the study to be performed (production, deep foundation costs, financial variables, offshore...).  INNOVATION IN OPERATIONS REGULATION OF ACTIVE AND REACTIVE SEVERAL WIND FARMS ON THE SAME NODE The topology of certain parks EDPR, evacuating several wind farms through the same node, creates a new challenge for EDPR, it is considered as a single wind farm for compliance with grid code proposes (regulation of active, reactive or voltage). There are no commercial tools to control grid code compliance in these specific situations when different technologies interact. EDPR developed a control system that depending on the data collected at the node and the data from each one of the difference sites, balance and send the appropriate instructions to each wind farm control system to guarantee grid code compliance. This requires some preliminary simulations of static and dynamic wind turbines and control systems behaviour for each site, to be able to define the balancing control algorithms.  MINIMIZING IMBALANCE COSTS One of the main challenges at EDPR consist on minimizing the error in the energy estimates of the six intraday market sessions, and thus minimizing the imbalance costs. To do so, EDPR has developed an adaptive system based on a non-conventional technology in the energy sector that corrects the original estimates based on the historical errors committed in past predictions. These algorithm improvements not only reduce costs but also enhances the integration of wind energy in the national electricity system.       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       78 76  EDPR 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR ·· 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EDP Inovação is the EDP group company responsible for promoting innovation and research and development within the different business units within the group, EDPR among them. It operates in three distinct areas: 1) technological development; 2) innovation in products, organization and processes; 3) transversal support for R&D+i.  WINDFLOAT The `WindFloat' project is one of the flagstaffs of the renewable R&D project list at EDP, with a deep waters offshore prototype that has been reporting excellent results after three years in operation under harsh conditions, having to endure waves up to 15 meters high, off the coast of Aguçadoura in the north of Portugal. This is the most ambitious innovation project on floating offshore technology conducted worldwide so far, the first wind energy turbine in open waters in the Atlantic ocean, and also the first time for a triangular semi-submersible floating structure supporting a 2 MW wind turbine allowing the utilization of offshore winds with great stability at water depths below 40 meters, existing at long distances from the coast. It is the first offshore wind energy project in the world not requiring the use of any heavy offshore lifting equipment. The whole process of final assembly, installation and commissioning preparation was performed on land, in a controlled environment. When the construction on land was completed in dry docks located in Setúbal, south of Lisbon, the structure was towed for about 350 kilometres in the open water. The capability to undertake the towing operation under such circumstances can be attributed to the performance and stability of WindFloat. These factors also allow any ready-to-use commercial wind turbines of any manufacturer to be installed on WindFloat. The project is a partnership between EDP, Repsol, Principle Power, A. Silva Matos, Vestas and InovCapital and is also supported by the Innovation Support Fund (FAI), involving more than 60 suppliers, more than two thirds are Portuguese. In March, while the competition for the offshore wind energy capacity tender in France was ongoing, EDPR hosted French journalists to visit the `Windfloat' project. The journalists met at the dispatch centre in Oporto, and were flown by helicopter to see from the sky, this project live and in action. In July, French mayors from 20 municipalities also paid a visit to this project, this time going on a boat out in the ocean to see the turbine operate. These visits were a great opportunity for EDPR to demonstrate how wind energy generation works offshore, while strengthening ties with key opinion leaders in France, a country that has historically relied greatly on nuclear energy. Last October, João Manso Neto participated in an international conference held in Lisbon, organized by the Wave Energy Centre (WavEC) in partnership with the United States Embassy in Portugal, where companies, research centres, public agencies and political decision-makers gathered to discuss about the transatlantic efforts to create a technology cluster capable of leveraging the tremendous economic potential of the sea. Wind offshore renewable energy was highlighted at the event and EDPR solid commitment to developing technologies for offshore wind exploration showcased with the WindFloat case.

INTEGRITY AND ETHICS Ethical behaviour is absolutely essential for the functioning of the economy. EDPR recognizes its importance and complexity, and is committed to address ethics and its compliance. But is employees' responsibility to comply with ethical obligations. GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR ETHICS Ethics are the cornerstone of EDPR strategy, to the extent that EDPR has a Code of Ethics that goes beyond just defining the company principles to be adopted, but also how employees and any other service provider working on behalf of EDPR should behave when dealing with the company stakeholders. The code of Ethics has its own regulation that defines a process and channels to report any potential incident or doubt on the application of the code. The Ethics Ombudsman is behind this communication channel, and to analyse and present to the Ethics Committee any potential ethical problem. The code is communicated and distributed to all employees and interested parties, and complemented with tailored training sessions.  ETHICS COMMITTEE The Ethics Committee will receive, register, process and report to the Board of Directors all reports regarding violations of the Code in matters of legislation and ethics, establishing, if appropriate, corrective actions. The Ethics Committee is composed of three members: the presidents of the Audit and Control Committee, the Related Parties Transactions Committee, and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. The Committee's main functions include: · Proposing corporate ethics instruments, policies, goals and targets. · Monitoring application of the Code of Ethics, laying down guidelines for its regulation and overseeing its proper application by the Company and its subsidiaries. · Analysing reported violations of the Code of Ethics, deciding on their relevance and admissibility. · Deciding if there is any need for a more in-depth investigation to ascertain the implications and persons involved. · Appointing the Ethics Ombudsman.  CODE OF ETHICS EDPR's Code of Ethics applies to all company employees, regardless of their position in the organization and working location, and they all must comply with. Our suppliers should be aligned with the spirit of our Code of Ethics, and this is reflected in our procurement policies. During 2014, a revision of the code was approved, to reinforce some areas such as integrity, human rights, compliance with the legislation and transparency. In addition, the revised code, is divided into principles of action, engagement with stakeholders and ethical process. This division aims to clearly state which are the values and the behaviours with stakeholders that anyone representing EDPR should have, and how the process of overseeing the code compliance works. After this revision, the code was announced and published on the Company's intranet and sent by email by the General Secretary to all employees. All new hires find the Code of Ethics included in the welcome pack that each employee receives when entering the Company and are required to return it with a signed acknowledgment.  ETHICS OMBUDSMAN In the first meeting of the Ethics Committee held in 2011, EDPR's Ethics Ombudsman was nominated. The Ethics Ombudsmen plays an essential role in the ethics process. He guarantees impartiality and objectivity in registering and documenting all complaints of ethical nature submitted to him. He monitors their progress and ensures that the identity of the complainants remains confidential, while entering into contact with them whenever appropriate, until the case is closed.  EDPR ETHICS PROCESS EDPR stakeholders, both internal and external, can easily start an ethical process or resolve doubts through the Ethics Channel, either contacting via email the Ethics Ombudsman or filling the form available in the corporate website. The Ethics Ombudsman guarantees transparency and professional secrecy throughout the entire process. In addition, EDPR provides employees with a whistleblowing channel enabling them to report directly and confidentially to the Audit and Control Committee any practice presumed illicit or any alleged accounting or financial irregularity in their Company. In 2014 there were no communications to the Ethics Ombudsmen regarding any irregularity at EDPR and no communications regarding any irregularity with material impact at EDPR though the whistleblowing channel.  CODE OF ETHICS REGULATION The Code of Ethics regulation, adopted by the Board of Directors in 2011, aims to regulate the application within EDPR of the Code of Ethics. Particularly, it defines the procedures for the reception, registration and processing of information received by the Company concerning violations of the Code in matters of legislation, ethics, conduct in the work environment, human rights, equal opportunities, integrity, relations with customers and suppliers, environment and sustainability. The Regulation of the Code of Ethics features aspects such as: · · · · Job description and responsibilities; Procedures; Confirmation, investigation and corrective measures; Confidentially and anonymity; Management supervision and revision.

Ethics Ombudsmen first confirms the events reported and submits a preliminary report on the initial confirmations to the Ethics Committee. Ethics Committee analyses every situation reported and decides as to whether it should be classified as a violation of the Code of Ethics. When conducting an investigation, the Company shall abide by the law and its own in-house rules. After the investigation is complete, the Committee decides whether any corrective or disciplinary action is required.  ETHICS PROGRAM Our commitment to ethics is reflected in our Ethics Program. It was first launched in 2010 and in order to renew ethical behaviours within the company and transmit the new additions to the code, will be performed again during the first half of 2015. The Ethics program is an important tool to assess the current status and promote awareness on the issue internally. The Program consists of an interpretative guide of the Code of Ethics, a survey to assess how ethics is understood by EDPR's workers and a training program. During 2015, the training program will consist on a transversal online session, to transmit general concepts to all employees, and specific on-site sessions, tailored to the different work positions and associated risks.  ANTI-BRIBERY REGULATION In order to ensure compliance with the standards of Anti-bribery Regulation in every geography where EDPR operates, the Company has developed an AntiBribery Policy of application to all EDPR Group, which was approved by its Board of Directors on December, 2014. This Anti-Corruption Policy will involve a series of new procedures regarding the relationships of EDPR employees with external parties, namely the approval of certain actions regarding hospitality to and from external parties, charitable donations, and sponsorships. This Policy will be implemented in the Group throughout 2015. A full description of the Ethics governance model can be found in the Corporate Governance Report.  EMPLOYEE RELATIONS EDPR is committed to respect freedom of trade union association and recognise the right to collective bargaining. Our commitment is reflected in the Code of Ethics, and its compliance is controlled through the Ethics Channel, where stakeholders can anonymously report on any infraction. At EDPR, from 919 employees, 21% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements apply to all employees working under an employment relationship with and for the account of the some companies of EDPR group, regardless of the type of contract, the professional group into which they are classified, their occupation or job. However, matters relating to the corporate organization itself, the laws of each country or even usage and custom in each country result in certain groups being expressly excluded from the scope of collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements that are applied at EDPR are usually negotiated at state level or regional level, and EDPR may be just one of the players among other leading sectorial companies in the negotiation with employees' representatives, and in some cases, governmental representatives. In Portugal and Brazil, EDP negotiates its own agreements with employees, and those apply to all employee working for companies of the group, including EDPR. Despite not taking an active part in the negotiations, EDPR wants to facilitate the broadcast of any update in those agreements. For example, in Portugal, during 2014 a new collective bargaining agreement was negotiated. EDPR organized training sessions for its employees to inform about the results of those negotiations. During the last years, EDPR has performed different benchmark analysis of the benefits stated at the different collective bargaining agreements that apply to our employees, comparing them against the benefits offered by the company and, in general terms, the company offers a more competitive benefits package compared to what is stated in the collective bargaining agreement. During 2014, representatives of the company held different meetings with employees' representatives to deal with some critical topics that affect EDPR, such as the health and safety of its employees, or the bonus payment that is being done in Brazil. In France, EDPR representatives defined a roadmap with the elected employees' representatives with the actions to follow in the short term.

EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION REMUNERATION STRUCTURE EDPR's remuneration policy approved by the General Shareholders Meeting on April 8th 2014 (with 99.6% votes in favour), submitted by the Board of Directors after a proposal of its Nominations and Remunerations Committee (that composed of three non-executive and independent Directors), defines a structure with a fixed remuneration for all members of the Board and a variable remuneration, with annual and multi-annual components, for the members of the Executive Committee. Fixed base (cash) remuneration Variable remuneration (cash bonus) Annual Multi-annual  The maximum annual variable remuneration approved by the General Shareholders Meeting for all the executive members of the Board of Directors was 1 million per year. EDPR has not incorporated any share remuneration or share purchase options plans as components of remuneration of its Directors. Variable annual and multiannual remuneration are a percentage of fixed annual component, with a superior weight for multi-annual vs annual component. The value of variable annual remuneration may range between 0% and 85% of the 80% of annual fixed remuneration. The value of variable multi-annual remuneration may range between 0% and 85% of the 120% of annual fixed remuneration. For the CFO and COOs there is a qualitative evaluation by the CEO about the annual performance, weighting 20% in the calculation of the annual variable remuneration and 32% of the multi-annual variable remuneration. The remaining is calculated based on the KPIs and respective weights indicated below. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to determine the amounts of the annual and multi-annual variable are aligned with the strategic grounds of the Company: growth, risk/return and efficiency.

(EDPR) has reached an agreement with Fiera Axium Infrastructure US L.P. (Fiera Axium) to sell a minority cash equity interest in a US wind portfolio with a total production capacity of 1,101 MW. Fiera Axium's interest in the portfolio will represent 394.5 MW and is the second asset rotation transaction announced by EDPR with Fiera Axium, further strengthening the existing partnership. The portfolio is comprised of 9 operating wind farms. All of the wind farms have long-term offtake agreements in place. Based on i) the transaction price and ii) the expected tax equity liabilities of the projects, the total enterprise value on the 1,101 MW portfolio amounts to US 1.7 billion of US Dollar translating to 1.54 million of US Dollar/MW. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. The offer contemplates an initial funding to occur upon obtaining regulatory approvals and a final funding to occur upon achievement of commercial operations of the assets under construction. Acquisition by EDPR of 45% of the share capital of EDP Renováveis Brasil In November 2014, EDP Renováveis, S.A. and EDP Energias do Brasil (EDP Brasil) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding envisaging the acquisition by EDPR of 45% of the share capital of EDP Renováveis Brasil, S.A. controlled by EDP Brasil. Following this transaction EDPR will control 100% of the share capital of EDPR Brasil. EDPR Brasil operates 84 MW of wind energy and has in execution 237 MW of wind energy projects with longterm power purchase agreements (PPAs) awarded in the 2011 and 2013 energy auctions. EDPR announces the sale of minority stakes in wind farms in Brazil to CTG In December 2014, EDP Renováveis, S.A. through its subsidiary EDPR Brasil entered into an agreement with CWEI (Brasil) Participações Ltda, a subsidiary of CTG to sell an equity shareholding of 49% in both operational and under development wind farms in Brasil. The transaction scope covers 84 MW in operation, as mentioned above, with an average age of 4 years, as well as 237 MW under development, remunerated according to longterm awarded contracts to sell the electricity produced for 20 years. EDP Renováveis executes project finance for 120 MW in Brazil On 26 January 2015, EDP Renováveis, S.A. (EDPR) has executed project finance structure agreements with the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) for the Baixa do Feijão project, which comprises four wind farms with a total capacity of 120 MW. The Baixa do Feijão project is currently under construction and is located in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, one of the windiest locations of Brazil. The long-term contracted debt facilities amount to 306 million of Brazilian Reais and its financial closing is subject to customary conditions. The execution of this agreement reflects EDPR financing strategy to contract long-term debt in local currency at competitive prices in order to mitigate the refinancing risk and to reduce the foreign exchange risk by having a natural hedge between revenues and costs. In December 2011, at the Brazilian energy A-5 auction, these four projects were awarded with 20-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) starting in January 2016.  INFORMATION ON AVERAGE PAYMENT TERMS TO SUPPLIERS In 2014 total payments made from Spanish companies to suppliers, amounted to 107,975 thousands with a weighted average payment period of 62.4 days, therefore grossly in line with the payment period stipulated by law of 60 days. Notwithstanding, the company is maintaining an optimization of its internal processes in order to settle all payments due within the maximum legal period.

This includes the reinforcement of existing electricity networks and the rehabilitation of existing roads or the construction of new roads. The investment in roads is necessary in order to transport heavy equipment (wind turbine components, power transformers, etc.) to the site during construction. The improved road system facilitates future maintenance activities after construction works, as well as improves access to remote locations for the surrounding communities. During the operation of our wind farms, these roads are maintained and further opportunities may be identified to increase the positive impact in the community. The integration of our generation capacity may also require upgrades in the distribution and transmission grids that belong to the system operators. Those upgrades indirectly benefit the quality of service offered in the surrounding areas by minimizing electricity supply interruptions. In 2014, EDPR invested 1.6 million Euros to developing these types of infrastructures.  G4 EC8 - UNDERSTANDING AND DESCRIBING SIGNIFICANT INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS, INCLUDING THE EXTENT OF IMPACTS Wind and solar energies create a positive impact on the local economies in terms of turnover, Gross Value Added (GVA), employment created and also in terms of energy security.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE G4 DMA - EDPR is a leading company in renewable energy. We produce clean and green energy, energy without emissions. Our strategy towards the environment is based on four pillars: the generation of CO2-free and waterfree energy, a strategy to minimize impacts during the life-cycle of our wind farms, a culture of respect for the biodiversity and a culture of a responsibility and recycling. EDPR is strongly committed to contribute to the protection of the environment and biodiversity through a proactive environmental management of its wind farms in operation, as is stated in our Environmental and Biodiversity policies. EDPR promotes biodiversity conservation and aspires to have an active role in contributing to the world's objective of reducing biodiversity loss. Wind farms development and operation typically occurs in rural areas where wind resource is abundant and the operation of wind farms is compatible with current ecosystem. We define specific measures to monitor and promote the local fauna conservation in all our business activities as reflected in our company's Biodiversity Policy. The operation stage of wind farms, with a useful life of 25 years, stands as the core of our business. According to this, we are really conscious of the importance of proper management of environmental matters in our facilities in operation, which is assured through the Environmental Management System (EMS). Our environmental strategy focuses on three core aspects: legal compliance, management of environmental risks and continuous improvement. Numerous environmental appraisal and monitoring procedures are incorporated in all phases of the business processes ensuring that these central pillars are enforced.  +  For additional information about what sets EDPR apart in terms of environmental management, please refer to the Environment section.  G4 EN3 - ENERGY CONSUMPTION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION Wind turbines require a small amount of electricity to operate. This energy consumption is generally selfconsumed. Given the intermittency of wind generation we sometimes need to consume electricity from the grid. The indirect CO2 emissions related to the consumed electricity is around 0.2% of the emissions avoided by the company.

Part of the equipment used for electricity generation purposes contains SF6 gasses and during 2014 we registered emissions of 4.37 kg of this gas, which is equivalent to 100t CO2 eq**. Note: Gas consumption emissions were estimated according to the GHG protocol. SF6 gas conversion factor: 22.8 tCO2/kg SF6 (4th IPCC Assessment Report)  G4 EN16 - ENERGY INDIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS (SCOPE 2) Our indirect emissions represent 0.2% of the total amount of emissions avoided and approximately 77% of the emissions are from the necessary electricity consumption by the wind farms. EDPR's CO2 indirect emissions represent 29,887 tons, 28,821 tons driven by electricity consumption by the wind farms and 1,066 tons electricity consumption by the offices.

Wind and solar energy has zero carbon emissions, contributing to the world's fight against climate change and does not produce harmful SOx, NOx, or mercury emissions, protecting valuable air and water resources. We estimated that our activities avoided the emission of 16,993 thousand tons of CO2. Even though our activity is based on the clean energy generation, we are conscious about promoting a culture of rational use of resources. During 2014, we continued promoting initiatives that foster environmental best practices in our offices. Note: To calculate the emissions avoidance, the energy generation has been multiplied by the CO2 eq emission factors of each country and state within the US. We considered the emission factor of just fossil fuel energy, as we considered that by increasing the generation of renewable energy, we are displacing these technologies, while other renewable technologies and nuclear plants will continue with its quota of generation.  G4 EN23 - TOTAL WEIGHT OF WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHOD More than 90% of the hazardous waste produced by wind farms is related to oil and oil-related wastes such as oil filters or oil containers, used mainly for lubrication of the turbines. The consumption of this oil is based on certain pre-defined replacement time frequencies (between 2 and 5 years, based on the component, oil type and manufacturer). The company has been actively working to improve the recycling rate of its hazardous wastes, through authorized waste haulers, reaching a 96% recycling rate in 2014 from a 75% in 2011. The following table summarizes the amount wastes generated per GWh in our facilities and the rate of recycling. Waste generated by EDPR 1  2014 1,092 55.2 26.2 95.9%  2013 910 47.4 30.0 95.4%  (%) 20% +16% -13% 0.6%  Total waste (t) Total waste (kg/GWh) Total hazardous waste (kg/GWh) % of hazardous waste recovered  Annual fluctuations in hazardous waste generated are heavily dependent on the pluri-annual oil replacement programs above mentioned. Non-hazardous wastes generated by the company include metals, plastics, paper or domestic garbage which is recycled in their vast majority. Note 1: In Europe, the method of disposal has been indicated by the waste hauler, while in the US the disposal method has been determined by the organizational defaults of the waste hauler. Waste generated by EDPR does not include Brazil wind farms. Note 2: For the purposes of this report, all wastes have been classified as Hazardous or Non-hazardous according to European Waste Catalogue; however, in each country where EDPR has a geographic presence, each wind farm is required to adhere to national law by following company procedures for handling, labelling, and storage of wastes to ensure compliance. In cases, like in the United States, when our operations generate small quantities of substances which fall into additionally-regulated categories­such as used oils and universal wastes­we follow strict standards for handling and disposal of these waste types to ensure we remain compliant with all applicable laws.  G4 EN24 - TOTAL NUMBER AND VOLUME OF SIGNIFICANT SPILLS Given our activity and our locations, oil spills and fires are the major environmental risks the company faces. The Environmental Management System is designed and implemented to prevent emergency situations from happening. But in case they happen, the system covers the identification and management of these, including the near-miss situations. EDPR defines as significant spill the ones above 0.16 m3 that reached the ground. Additionally, EDPR registers near miss situations, when registered incident does not reach the category of significant spill. In 2014, we had 6 significant spills with a total volume of 1.58 m3 of oil spilled, and 1 incipient fire with an area of 25 m2 of dry scrub burned. All cases were properly managed: oil spills were confined early and contaminated soil was collected and managed; the incipient fire occurred in an agricultural area with some dry bushes without significant natural value, being promptly suffocated by the staff on site using the fire extinguishers. Additionally, 30 near miss were registered driven by small oil leaks that did not reach bare soil.

DECISIONS THAT CAN ONLY BE ADOPTED BY A QUALIFIED MAJORITY According to EDPR's Articles of Association and as established on the law, both ordinary and extraordinary General Shareholders' Meetings are validly constituted when first called if the Shareholders, either present or represented by proxy, represent at least twenty five percent (25%) of the subscribed voting capital. On the second call, the General Shareholders' Meeting will be validly constituted regardless of the amount of the capital present. To validly approve the issuance of bonds, the increase or reduction of capital, the transformation, merger or spin-off of the Company, and in general any necessary amendment to the Articles of Association, the Ordinary or Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting will need: on the first call, that the Shareholders, either present or represented by proxy, represent at least fifty percent (50%) subscribed voting capital and, on the second call, that the Shareholders, either present or represented by proxy, represent at least twenty five percent (25%) of the subscribed voting capital. In the event that the shareholders attending represent less than fifty percent (50%) of the subscribed voting capital, the above mentioned resolutions will only be validly adopted with the favourable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the present or represented capital in the General Shareholders' Meeting. EDPR has not established any mechanism that may intend to cause mismatching between the right to receive dividends or the subscription of new securities and the voting right of each common share and has not adopted mechanisms that hinder the passing of resolutions by shareholders, including fixing a quorum for resolutions greater than that provided for by law. Concerning the above mentioned and according to the modification introduced on the Spanish Companies Law published on December 24th, 2014, EDPR will present on the next General Shareholders Meeting a proposal to modify the Articles of Association in order to include the changes introduced the new percentage for the valid constitution of the General Shareholders Meeting that are more favourable to the shareholders and more protective of their position.  II. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION A. COMPOSITION 15. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MODEL EDPR is a Spanish Company listed in a regulated stock exchange in Portugal. EDP Renováveis' corporate organization is subject to its personal law and to the extent possible, to the recommendations contained in the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code, ("Código de Governo das Sociedades") approved by the Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários (CMVM) (Portuguese Securities Market Commission) in July 2013. This governance code is available to the public at CMVM website (www.cmvm.pt). The organization and functioning of EDPR corporate governance model aims to achieve the highest standards of corporate governance, business conduct and ethics referenced on the best national and international practices in corporate governance. EDPR has adopted the governance structure in effect in Spain. It comprises a General Shareholders' Meeting and a Board of Directors that represents and manages the Company. As required by law and the Articles of Association, the Company's Board of Directors has set up four committees. These are the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee and the Related-Party Transactions Committee. In order to ensure a better understanding of EDPR corporate governance by its shareholders, the Company posts its updated Articles of Association as well as its Committees Regulations at www.edprenovaveis.com. The governance model of EDPR was designed to ensure the transparent, meticulous separation of duties and the specialization of supervision. EDPR' bodies for the management and supervision model are the following: · General Shareholders' Meeting · Board of Directors · Executive Committee · Audit and Control Committee · External auditor The purpose of the choice of this model is to adapt, to the extent possible, the Company's corporate governance structure to the Portuguese legislation. The governance model adopted by EDPR therefore seeks, as far as it is compatible with its personal law, to correspond to the so-called "Anglo-Saxon" model set forth in the Portuguese Commercial Companies Code, in which the management body is the Board of Directors, and the supervision and control duties are of the responsibility of an Audit and Control Committee. The experience of institutional operating indicates that the governance model adopted by the shareholders is appropriate to the corporate organization of EDPR activity, especially because it affords transparency and a healthy balance between the management functions of the Executive Committee, the supervisory functions of the Audit and Control Committee and oversight by different Board of Directors special committees. The institutional and functional relationship between the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee and the other non-executive members of the Board of Directors has been of internal harmony conductive to the development of the Company's business.

PROCEDURES FOR HIRING ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR In EDPR there is a policy of pre-approval by the Audit and Control Committee for the selection of the External Auditor and any related entity for non-audit services, according to Recommendation IV.2 of the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code. This policy was strictly followed during 2014.

Additionally, EDPR has a Responsibilities Model and a SCIRF Manual (Internal Control System over Financial Reporting), in which individuals, governing bodies and committees responsible for implementing and managing the internal control system are indicated. The Responsibilities Model includes the functions and main activities in the management and maintenance of the system at all levels of the organization including monitoring activities related to the annual cycle, the implementation of controls and documentation of evidence and supervision activities. The SCIRF Manual incorporates the general principles of the Internal Control System over Financial Reporting, as well as the methodology used, the procedures for ensuring the effectiveness of internal control and design of models, documentation, evaluation and reporting. In line with the general principles of the model adopted by EDPR for the management of the SCIRF, the COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission), the responsibility for overseeing the Internal Control System lies in the Board of Directors and the Audit and Control Committee. The CEO is accountable before the Board, must ensure the proper functioning and effectiveness of the SCIRF, promoting its design, implementation and maintenance. The Executive Committee must support the CEO in this task, guiding the development of the Entity Level Controls of the Company and the controls in their areas of responsibility, relying when necessary on other levels of the organization. Also, the Senior Managers are responsible for evaluating any deficiencies and implementing appropriate improvement opportunities. To fulfil these responsibilities, EDPR's Internal Audit offers support and advice to the management and development of the SCIRF.  51. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF INTERNAL AUDIT The Internal Audit function in EDPR Group is a corporate function carried out by the Internal Audit Department, that reports both to the Chairman of EDPR's Executive Committee and to EDPR's Audit and Control Committee. Board of Directors  Executive Committe  Audit and Control Committe  Internal Audit  52. RISK MANAGEMENT EDPR's Risk Management is as an integrating element of all organizational processes and decisions and not a stand-alone activity separated from the main activities of the company. It includes from strategic planning to evaluation of new investments and contracts. Risk Management at EDPR is supported by three distinct organizational functions, each one with a different role: Strategy (Risk Profiler), Management (Risk Manager) and Controlling (Risk Controller). Market, credit and operational risks are identified and assessed and, following the result of the assessment, Risk Policies are defined and implemented across the company. These policies are aimed to mitigate risks without compromising potential opportunities, thus, optimizing return versus risk exposure. During 2014, EDPR defined or reviewed three new Global Risk Policies: Counterparty Risk Policy, Interest Rate Risk Policy and Operational Risk Policy. These policies are already implemented or will be implemented throughout 2015.  53. RISK AREAS AND RISK FACTORS Risk Management at EDPR is focused on covering all market, credit and operational risks of the company. In order to have a holistic view of risks, they were grouped in Risk Areas following EDPR's business cycle. The following list summarizes Risk Areas defined within EDPR: 1. Countries & regulations - Changes in regulations may impact EDPR's business in a given country; 2. Revenues - Revenues received by EDPR's projects may diverge from what is expected; 3. Financing - EDPR may not be able to raise enough cash to finance its planned Capex; or to fulfil its financial obligations due to changes in exchange rates or bankruptcy of counterparties;  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       4. Wind turbine contracts - Changes in turbine prices may impact projects' profitability; or there may not be sufficient turbine supply to build planned wind farms; 5. Pipeline development - EDPR may deliver an installed capacity different from its targets or suffer delays and/or anticipations in its installation; 6. Operations - Projects may deliver a volume different from expected due to turbine availability; financial results can be impacted by human errors. Within each Risk Area, risks are classified in Risk Groups and finally into Risk Factors. Risk factors are the source of the risk and the purpose of Risk Management at EDPR is to measure, control and eventually mitigate all risk factors that affect the company.  EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  133 131  EDPR is managing its exposure to regulatory risks through diversification by being present in several countries and through participation as an active member in several wind associations. Regulatory Risk in each of EDPR's countries is monitored continuously, considering current regulation, potential drafts of new laws, feedback from associations, evolution of installed renewable generation capacity and other inputs. EDPR has developed an internal quantitative assessment of Regulatory Risk that serves as an indicator for changes in supporting schemes. This measure is updated annually in all EDPR's geographies. Regulatory Risk is also considered ex-ante at the moment of the investment, through sensitivity analyses that are performed to evaluate its impact in project profitability under different scenarios.  1. COUNTRIES AND REGULATIONS 1. I) COUNTRY RISK Country Risk is defined as the probability of occurrence of a financial loss in a given country due to macroeconomics, political or natural disasters. EDPR has defined a Country Risk Policy that assesses country risk through an internal scoring based on publicly available data. This internal scoring is compared with external assessments from renowned parties. Each risk factor affecting country risk is evaluated independently to decide on potential mitigating actions: · Macroeconomic Risk: Risks from the country's economic evolution, affecting revenue or cost time of the investments · Political Risk: All possible damaging actions or factors for the business of foreign firms that emanate from any political authority, governmental body or social group in the host country · Natural disaster risk: Natural phenomena (seismicity, weather) that may impact negatively in the business conditions. Before approving a new project in a new geography, EDPR analyses the risk of the new country and compares it to our existing portfolio. Mitigation measures may be decided when this risk is above a certain threshold. 1. II) REGULATORY RISK The development and profitability of renewable energy projects are subject to policies and regulatory frameworks. The jurisdictions in which EDPR operates provide different types of incentives supporting energy generated from renewable sources. Remuneration schemes have become less competitive in some countries due to the financial crisis and it cannot be guaranteed that current support will be maintained in all EDPR's geographies or that future renewable energy projects will benefit from current support measures. Regulation promoting green energy has been revised or is under revision in some of the countries where EDPR is present. In the US, renewable generation from wind has been incentivized through Production Tax Credits (PTC) at a Federal level for projects demonstrating beginning of construction before end of 2014. Additionally, it is still incentivized through State RPS Programs that allow receiving RECs (Renewable Energy Credit) for each MWh of renewable generation. 2. REVENUES 2. I) MARKET PRICE RISK EDPR faces limited electricity price risk as it pursues a strategy of being present in countries or regions with long term visibility on revenues. In most countries where EDPR is present, prices are determined through regulated framework mechanisms. In those countries with no regulated tariffs, power purchase agreements are negotiated with different offtakers to eliminate electricity and Green Certificate or REC price risks. Despite EDPR's strategy of eliminating market price risk, EDPR still has some wind farms with merchant exposure. In Europe, EDPR operates in countries where the selling price is defined by a feed-in-tariff (Portugal, France and Italy) or in markets where, on top of the electricity price, EDPR receives either a pre-defined regulated premium or a green certificate, whose price is achieved on a regulated market (Spain, Belgium, Poland, and Romania). EDPR is also developing investment activity in the UK, where current incentive system is based on green certificates but will change to a feed in tariff. In countries with a pre-defined regulated premium or a green certificate scheme, EDPR is exposed to electricity price fluctuations. Considering current PPAs in place, EDPR is exposed to electricity price risk in Romania, in Poland and partially in Spain. Additionally, in European countries with a green certificate scheme (Romania and Poland), EDPR is exposed to fluctuation on the price of green certificates. The US market does not provide a regulated framework system for the electricity price. Nevertheless, renewable generation is incentivized through PTCs (Production Tax Credits) and regional RPS programs that allow receiving RECs (Renewable Energy Credit) for each MWh of renewable generation. REC prices are very volatile and depend on the regional supply/demand equilibrium in the relevant market. Most of EDPR's capacity in the US has predefined prices determined by bundled (electricity + REC) longterm contracts with local utilities in line with the Company's policy of avoiding market price risk. Despite existing long term contracts, some EDPR's wind farms in the US do not have PPA and are selling merchant with exposure to electricity and REC price  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT 134 EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT     132 ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  risks. Additionally, some wind farms with existing PPAs do not sell their energy where it is produced and are therefore exposed to basis risk (different in price between the location where energy is produced and that where energy is sold). In Ontario (Canada), the selling price is defined by a long term feed-in-tariff, thus, there is no electricity price exposure. In Brazilian operations, the selling price is defined through a public auction which is later translated into a long-term contract. Electricity price exposure is almost null, with little exposure for the production above or below the contracted production. Under EDPR's global approach to minimize the exposure to market electricity prices, the Company evaluates on a permanent basis if there are any deviations to the pre-defined limits (measured through EBITDA at risk, Net Income at risk and total merchant exposure). EDPR intends to eliminate Green Certificates and REC price risk with the signing of bundled PPAs with private offtakers, which include the sale of the electricity and the Green Certificate or REC. In some cases, the offtaker may be interested in contracting only the Green Certificate or the REC, thus a GCPA (Green Certificate Purchase Agreement) or a RECPA (REC Purchase Agreement) is signed. During 2014, EDPR signed or reviewed PPAs in Europe for 716 MW and in the US for 459 MW. In those geographies with remaining merchant exposure, EDPR uses various commodity hedging instruments in order to minimize the exposure to fluctuating market prices. In some cases, due to the lack of liquidity of financial derivatives, it may not be possible to successfully hedge all merchant exposure (i.e. no financial derivatives exist for green certificates nor RECs). In 2014, EDPR financially hedged most of its generation in Poland and Romania. In Spain, hedges were distributed along 2014 but unhedged volumes were affected by significant low prices in Q1. As aforementioned, some US wind farms have exposure to electricity price risk or basis risk (difference in electricity price between locations). EDPR hedges electricity price and basis exposures through financial swaps or FTR (Financial Transmission Rights). The market of GCPA or RECPA is very illiquid and few financial derivatives exist for Green Certificates nor RECs. Therefore, all exposure to Green Certificates or REC prices cannot be eliminated. 2. II) ENERGY PRODUCTION RISK The amount of electricity generated by EDPR's wind farms is dependent on weather conditions, which vary across locations, from season to season and from year to year. Variation on the amount of electricity that is generated affects EDPR's operating results and efficiency. Not only the total wind production in a specific location is relevant, but also the profile of production. Wind usually blows more at night than at daytime, when energy prices are lower. Generation profile will affect the discount in price of a wind farm versus a baseload generation. Finally, curtailment of a wind farm will also affect its production. Curtailment occurs when the production of  a wind farm is stopped by the TSO (Transmission System Operators) for external reasons to the company. Examples of cases of curtailment are upgrades in transmission lines, high level of renewable generation production with low demand (very exceptional). EDPR mitigates wind resource volatility and seasonality through geographical diversification of its asset base in different countries and regions. · EDPR acknowledges the correlation between different wind farms in its portfolio that allows for this geographical diversification, which enables EDPR to partially offset wind variations in each region and to keep the total energy generation relatively steady. Currently, EDPR is present in 12 countries: Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, UK (no generation), Italy, US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico (no generation). · In some geographies there is an inverse correlation between wind volume and electricity price, implying a natural hedge. EDPR has analysed in detail the potential use of financial products to hedge wind risk, and EDPR might use this product to mitigate risk in specific cases. Profile risk and curtailment risk are managed ex-ante. For every new investment, EDPR factors the effect that expected generation profile and curtailment will have on the output of the wind farm. Generation profile and curtailment of EDPR's wind farms are constantly monitored by Risk department to detect potential future changes.  3. FINANCING 3. I) RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MARKET EDPR finances its wind farms through project finance or corporate debt. In both cases, a variable interest rate might imply significant fluctuations in interest payments. On the other hand, due to EDPR's presence in several countries, revenues denominated in different currencies. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on financial results. 3. I) A) INTEREST RATE RISK Given the policies adopted by EDPR Group, current exposure to variable interest rate is not significant and financial cash flows are substantially independent from the fluctuation of interest rates. The purpose of interest rate risk management policies is to reduce the exposure of long term debt cash flows to market fluctuations, mainly by contracting long term debt with a fixed rate. · When long term debt is issued with floating rates, EDPR settles derivative financial instruments to swap from floating to fixed rate. · EDPR has a portfolio of interest-rate derivatives with maturities of up to 13 years. Sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest-rate fluctuations are periodically performed. Taking into account risk management policy and approved exposure limits, the Finance team identifies, evaluates, and submits the financial strategy appropriate to each project/location for the Executive  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       Committee's approval. Global Risk Area supports the Finance team in interest rate hedging decisions. Repricing calendar of debt is continuously monitored together with interest rates in order to detect good timing for interest rate hedging. 3. I) B) EXCHANGE RATE RISK EDPR has international operations and is exposed to the exchange-rate risk resulting from investments in foreign subsidiaries. Currently, currency exposure is to U.S. dollar, Romanian leu, Polish zloty, Brazilian real, British pound and Canadian dollar. EDPR hedges risk against currency fluctuations by financing in the same currency as the revenues of the project. When local financing is not available, EDPR hedges debt cash flows though cross currency interest rate swaps. EDPR also contracts foreign exchange forwards to hedge the risk in specific transactions, mainly in payments to suppliers which may be denominated in different currencies. EDPR's hedging efforts minimize exchange rate volatility, but do not eliminate completely this risk due to high costs associated to hedging FX in certain situations. 3. II) COUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss could occur, either a direct economic loss if the transaction has a positive value at the moment of default (counterparty credit risk) or a replacement cost due to change of the counterparty (counterparty operational risk). During 2014, EDPR updated its Global Counterparty Risk Policy to account for Counterparty Operational Risk. It is now implemented across the company. 3. II) A) COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK If the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default, an economic loss would occur. To control credit risk at EDPR, thresholds of Expected Loss and Unexpected Loss are established as defined in Basel Standards and re-evaluated monthly. If threshold is surpassed by any counterparty or by the company as a whole, mitigation measures are implemented in order to remain within the preestablished limit. 3. II) B) COUNTERPARTY OPERATIONAL RISK If the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty does not have a positive economic value at the time of default, it will impact operations. Despite no direct loss at the time of default, the replacement of the counterparty could imply a cost to EDPR due to potential delays, higher contract value with a new counterparty (replacement costs), etc. Construction and O&M subcontractors are counterparties to which EDPR is exposed from an operational point of view. To minimize the probability of incurring in potential replacement costs with counterparties, EDPR's policy concerning counterparty operational risk is managed by an analysis of the technical capacity,  EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  135 133  competitiveness, credit notation and replacement cost of the counterparty. 3. III) LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk of EDPR not meeting its financial obligations. EDPR's strategy to manage liquidity risk is to ensure that its liquidity is sufficient to meet financial liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, and without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to EDPR's reputation. Different funding sources are used such as Tax Equity investors, multilateral organizations, project finance, corporate debt and asset rotation. EDPR uses a financial model to forecast liquidity risk in the medium and long term to meet strategic targets previously set (EBITDA, debt ratio and others).  4. WIND TURBINE CONTRACTS The wind turbine generator (WTG) is a key element in the development of EDPR's wind-related energy projects, as the shortfall or an unexpected sharp increase in WTG prices can dramatically affect development of new projects and their profitability. WTG represents on average 70 to 80% of an onshore wind farm capital expenditure, and around 40% of an offshore wind farm. 4. I) WIND TURBINE PRICE RISK Price of wind turbines is affected, not only by market fluctuations of the materials used in the turbines, but also by the demand of wind turbines. For every new project, EDPR secures the demand risk that might increase price of the turbines. With regards to market risk of the materials used to manufacture wind turbines, an escalation formula is negotiated with wind turbine manufacturers. EDPR might hedge some of the market exposure of this escalation formula if exposure is above a preestablished limit and the market is liquid. 4. II) WIND TURBINE SUPPLY RISK The demand for new wind farms may offset the offer of turbines by WTG manufacturers. Currently, the local component requirement in some geographies (Ex: Brazil) creates this shortfall situation. EDPR faces limited risk to the availability and price increase of WTG's due to existing framework agreements with major global wind turbines suppliers. The Company uses a large mix of turbines suppliers in order to diversify wind turbine supply risk. For geographies with specific requirements of local component, EDPR does not engage in a project before securing the supply of wind turbines.  5. PIPELINE 5. I) DEVELOPMENT RISK Wind farms are subject to strict regulations at different authority levels (international, national, state, regional and local) relating to the development, construction, grid interconnection and operation of power plants. Among other things, these laws regulate landscape and environmental aspects,  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   136 EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT     134 EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  building licenses, land use and land securing and access to the grid issues. While level of exigency might be different depending on the geographies, EDPR acknowledges a trend for legislations to align towards concentrating the most restrictive rules and development risks on the consenting (environmental and urban permissions) and interconnection (connection of the wind farm to the national grid). In this context, EDPR's experience gathered in different countries is useful to anticipate and deal with similar situations in other countries. During the development and design phase, EDPR focuses on the optimization of its projects. By mastering the variables, such as choice of locations, lay-out, etc, the objective is to make our projects more resilient to permitting risks. Additionally, EDPR mitigates development risk by generating optionality, with development activities in 12 different countries (Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, UK, Italy, US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico) and a portfolio of projects in several stages of maturity. EDPR has a large pipeline of projects that provide a "buffer" to overcome potential delays in the development of prioritized projects, ensuring growth targets and being able to compensate permitting delays in some geographies. 5. II) EXECUTION RISK During the construction of the foundations, interconnection and substation of a wind farm, and the installation of the wind turbines, different events (bad weather, accidents, etc) might occur that could imply an over cost or a delay in the commercial operation date of the wind farm: · The delay implies a postponement of cash flows, affecting profitability of the investment. · When a wind farm has a PPA, a delay of the commercial operation date might imply the payment of LDs, with the consequent loss of revenues and the impact on annual financial results.  While execution risk in onshore wind farms is significant, but not relevant, for offshore wind farms it could be higher. During the design phase, EDPR engineering teams supervise the engineering and the installation method. Construction is subcontracted to experienced construction companies, after verifying their creditworthiness. For offshore wind farms, EDPR has partnered with large companies with previous experience in large electricity generation projects or offshore construction, in order to benefit from their knowledge and share the execution risk. In both cases, a critical path analysis is performed to assess the reliability of construction and installation plan.  6. OPERATIONS 6. I) WIND TURBINE PERFORMANCE RISK Wind farm output depends upon the operating availability of the turbines and the operating performance of the equipment, mainly the components of wind turbines and transformers. EDPR mitigates this risk by using a mix of turbine suppliers which minimizes technological risk, avoiding exposure to a unique manufacturer. EDPR also engages wind turbine suppliers through medium-term full-scope maintenance agreements to ensure alignment in minimizing technology risk. Finally, EDPR has created an O&M program with adequate preventive and scheduled maintenance program. EDPR externalized non-core technical O&M activities of its wind farms, while primary and value added activities continue controlled by EDPR.  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       54. RISK FUNCTIONS AND FRAMEWORK Risk Management at EDPR is supported by three distinct organizational functions, each one with a Risk functions  EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT EDPR · 2014MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  137 135  different role: Strategy (Risk Profiler), Management (Risk Manager) and Controlling (Risk Controller). Description · Global Risk Department provides analytically supported proposals to general strategic issues · Responsible for proposing guidelines and policies for risk management within the company · Implement defined policies by Global Risk · Responsible for day-to-day operational decisions and for related risk taking and risk mitigating positions · Responsible for follow-up of the results of risk taking decisions and for contrasting alignment of operations with general risk policy approved by the board power purchase agreements, new investments, energy hedges along with pipeline status and the EBITDA at Risk. It helps to control the implementation of defined policies and the exposure to most important risk factors. · Risk Committee: Held every quarter, it is the forum where new analyses are discussed and newly defined policies are proposed in order to send to the Executive Committee for approval. Additionally, EDPR's overall risk position is reviewed. · By the end of 2014 the Executive Committee approved the creation of a Financial Risk Committee. The Committee will held meetings every quarter starting in 2015 and will be a forum to review financial strategy and mitigation measures for main financial risks (FX and interest rates).  Strategy ­ General risk strategy & policy  Management ­ Risk management & risk business decisions  Controlling ­ Risk control  These three Risk Functions work together following EDPR's Risk Framework, through which major strategic questions of the Executive Committee are translated into specific guidelines or policies, to be used by managers in their day-to-day decisions. The Risk Committee is the forum where the different Risk Functions discuss the policies to be implemented and control the risk exposure of the company. EDPR's Risk Committee integrates and coordinates all Risk Functions and assures the link between corporate's risk appetite and defined strategy and the operations of the company. In order to separate discussions on business decisions from new analyses and the definition of new policies, EDPR has created three distinct meetings of the Risk Committee with different periodicity: · Restricted Risk Committee: Held every month, it covers the risk of new transactions such as new  55. DETAILS ON THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED IN THE COMPANY REGARDING THE PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING FINANCIAL INFORMATION With the purpose of not only controlling risks, but also managing them ex-ante, EDPR has created Global Risk policies that are enforceable at a Global Level. These policies are proposed and discussed in the Risk Committee and approved by the Executive Committee. During 2013, EDPR defined or reviewed four Global Risk Policies, which are already implemented or in the process to be implemented throughout 2014: · Energy Price Hedging Policy · Counterparty Credit Risk Policy · Country Risk Policy · FX Risk Policy Compliance with Global Risk policies is verified every month in the Restricted Risk Committee. preparation of qualified financial information, assessment of the risks of financial reporting, existence of control activities to mitigate risks of error, information and communication and evaluation mechanisms. SCOPE REVISION AND UPDATE The SCIRF Manual includes the annual update of the scope that aims to identify companies, areas and processes that must be included in the scope of SCIRF, according to criteria of materiality and risk, including the risk of error or fraud. The risk analysis included in the scoping process for SCIRF, includes both the different types of risk (operational, economic, financial, technological or legal) and the control objectives of financial reporting (existence and occurrence, completeness, measurement, presentation, disclosure and comparability, and rights and obligations in terms of their potential impact on the financial statements). The results of the updated scope with the methodology outlined are communicated at all levels of the organization involved in the SCIRF and supervised by the Audit Committee.  INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING EDPR has an Internal Control System over Financial Reporting (SCIRF) updated and monitored in line with international standards of Internal Control. This system covers the main aspects of the COSO framework: maintaining a control environment for the  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   138 EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT     136 EDPR · 2014 ANNUAL REPORT ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  CONTROL ACTIVITIES In documented SCIRF processes and controls, information capture mechanisms are established (including identification of the scope of consolidation) and steps and checks that are carried out for the preparation of the financial information that will be part of consolidated financial statements are specified. The procedures for review and approval of financial information are provided by the areas of Planning and Control, and Administration, Consolidation and Tax. Financial information is monitored in the scope of its competences by the Audit Committee, prior to the formulation of the accounts by the Board of Directors. The SCIRF includes control activities related to these processes, embodied in Entity Level Controls, Process Controls and General Computer Controls. These processes include review and approval activities of the financial information which are described in the processes of elaboration of individual accounts, preparation of consolidated accounts and processing of consolidated financial statements. EDPR has descriptions of Competency Profiles for the Positions to be carried out in the exercise of the main features of each position that includes a description of their main responsibilities. These include the descriptions of the key positions of those involved in the preparation of financial information. These descriptions include responsibilities in the preparation of financial information and compliance with internal control procedures. The documentation of processes and associated controls designed include among others, the completion of closure activities by completing monthly closing checklists by entity, setting time limits for the closures, the identification of the relevance of the operations in order to be reviewed at the appropriate level, conducting analytical reviews of financial information, the existence of limitations in systems to prevent erroneous records or by unauthorized persons, analysis of deviations from the budget, the analysis in Executive Committees of relevant and significant facts that could cause a significant impact on the accounts, or the allocation of responsibilities for calculating amounts to be provisioned for them to be carried out by authorized personnel with the right skills. In addition to the mentioned processes, major transactional processes resulting from the scope are documented. The description of the activities and controls are designed with the aim of ensuring the registration, evaluation, appropriate presentation and disclosure of transactions in financial reporting. Control activities of EDPR's SCIRF also include those relating to systems and information technology (Computer General Controls) following an international reference, the COBIT framework (Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies). The importance of this area is that information systems are the tools with which financial information is prepared, and is therefore relevant for transactions conducted with them. These control activities include those related to access control to applications and systems, segregation of duties, management of corrective and preventive maintenance, new projects implementation,  administration and management of the systems, facilities and operations (back-ups, security incidents) and their proper monitoring and planning. These activities are developed taking into account the requirements of control and supervision. Among the activities of SCIRF's scope update, there is a periodic analysis of the existence of service suppliers that perform relevant activities in relation to the processes of preparing financial information. SCIRF SUPERVISION The Audit Committee supervises the SCIRF in the scope of the exercise of their activities through the monitoring and supervision of the developed mechanisms for SCIRF's implementation, evolution and evaluation, and the results of the scope analysis and the extent of the situation in terms of coverage. To this end, the Audit Committee is assisted by the Internal Audit Department. EDPR has an Internal Audit Department under the President of the Executive Committee and is overseen by the Audit Committee as provided in the Basic Internal Audit Act. The main functions of the Internal Audit Department are set out in the Basic Internal Audit Act, which includes, among others, the evaluation activities of internal control systems, including the internal control system over financial reporting. The annual work plans of the Audit Department obtain the opinion of the Audit Committee, which is reported about their implementation. Among these activities, Internal Audit supports the Audit Committee in monitoring the implementation and maintenance of SCIRF and reports the results of the evaluation, improvement actions identified and their evolution. The entity has action plans for improvement actions identified in SCIRF's assessment processes, which are accompanied and supervised by the Internal Audit Department, considering their impact on the financial information. Also in the year 2014, as in previous years, a process of self-certification was made by the heads of the various process owners regarding proper documentation update on SCIRF controls and processes in their area of responsibility and the implementation of controls with corresponding evidence. SCIRF EVALUATION Besides the monitoring and evaluation activities described in the preceding paragraph, in case the auditors identified internal control weaknesses in the scope of their financial audit work, they are expected to communicate these circumstances to the Audit Committee, which regularly monitors the results of the audit work. Additionally, in 2014 the EDPR Group decided to have its SCIRF audited by the external auditor. As a result of its evaluation, the external auditor issued a report with a favourable opinion on SCIRF of the EDPR Group, according to ISAE 3000 (International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000).

INVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENT EDPR seeks to provide to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders all the relevant information about the Company and its business environment, on a regular basis. The promotion of transparent, consistent, rigorous, easily accessible, and high quality information is of fundamental importance to an accurate perception of the Company's strategy, financial situation, accounts, assets, prospects, risks, and significant events. EDPR, therefore, looks to provide investors with accurate information that can support them in making informed, clear, and concrete investment decisions. The Investor Relations Department was created to ensure a direct and permanent contact with all market related agents and stakeholders, to guarantee the equality between shareholders and to prevent imbalances in the information access. The EDPR Investor Relations Department (IR) is the intermediary between EDPR and its actual and potential shareholders, the financial analysts that follow Company's activity, all investors and other members of the financial community. The main purpose of the department is to guarantee the principle of equality among shareholders, by preventing asymmetries in access the information and reducing the gap between market perception and Company's strategy and intrinsic value. The department responsibility comprises developing and implementing EDPR's communication strategy and preserving an appropriate institutional and informative relationship with the financial market, the stock exchange at which EDPR shares trade and the regulatory and supervisory entities (CMVM ­ Comissão de Mercado de Valores Mobiliários ­ in Portugal and CNMV ­ Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores ­ in Spain). EDPR is clearly aware of the importance of detailed and transparent information, delivered on-time to the market. Consequently, EDPR publishes Company's price sensitive information before the opening or following the closing of the NYSE Euronext Lisbon stock exchange through CMVM's information system and, simultaneously, make that same information available on the website investors' section and through the IR department's mailing list. In 2014, EDPR made 47 press releases. Additionally, the IR Department also elaborates and makes available quarterly, semi-annual and annual results Company Bank of America Merrill Lynch Barclays BBVA Berenberg BES BPI Caixa BI Citigroup Deutsche Bank presentations, hand-outs, key data files and interim presentations. On each earnings announcement, EDPR promotes a conference call and webcast, at which the Company's management updates the market on EDPR's activities. On each of these events shareholders, investors and analysts had the opportunity to directly submit their questions and to discuss EDPR's results as well as the Company's outlook and strategy. EDPR IR Department is coordinated by Rui Antunes and is located at the Company's head offices in Madrid, Spain. The department structure and contacts are as follows: IR Contacts: Rui Antunes, Head of Planning & Control, Investor Relations and Sustainability Calle Serrano Galvache 56 Centro Empresarial Parque Norte Edificio Olmo ­ 7th floor 28033 ­ Madrid ­ España Website: www.edprenovaveis.com/investors E-Mail: ir@edpr.com Phone: +34 902 830 700 / Fax: +34 914 238 429 In 2014, EDPR promoted and participated in several events, namely EDP Group investor day, road shows, presentations to investors and analysts, meetings and conference calls.

DETAILS OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE IMPLEMENTED According to article 2 of CMVM Regulation 4/2013, EDPR informs that the present Report has been drafted under the Recommendations of CMVM'S Corporate Governance Code published on July, 2013.

ANALYSIS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE IMPLEMENTED The following table shows the CMVM recommendations set forth in the code and indicates EDPR's compliance with it and the place in this report in which they are described in more detail. During 2014, EDPR has continued its consolidation task as to the Company's governance principles and practices. The high level of compliance with the best governance practices by EDPR was once again recognised by an independent study developed in 2014 by the Universidade Católica Portuguesa (Portuguese Catholic University) at the request of AEM ­ Associação de Empresas Emitentes de Valores Cotados em Mercado (Portuguese Listed Companies Association), within which the Company was given the maximum rating ­ AAA - based on the Company's 2013 Governance Report and compliance with the abovementioned CMVM Recommendations. Also in order to comply with the Recommendation II.2.5 of the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code, and according to the results of the reflection made by the Audit and Control Committee, the governance model that was adopted has been ensuring an effective performance and articulation of EDPR Social Bodies and proved to be adequate to the Company's governance structure without any constraints to the performance of its checks and balances system adopted to justify the changes made in the Governance practices of EDPR. The explanation of CMVM's recommendations that EDPR does not adopt or that the Company deems not applicable, reasoning and other relevant comments as well as reference to the part of the report where the description may be found, are in the table below. In this context, EDPR states that it has adopted the CMVM recommendations on the governance of listed companies provided in the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code, with the exceptions indicated below.  #.#.

AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN SPAIN On December 2012, by means of Law15/2012 of 27 December, the Spanish Government approved 7% acrossthe-board tax on electricity generation, as well as new taxes on nuclear and large-scale hydropower, plus a new carbon levy. The tax will be applied from 2013 onwards. On 4 February 2013, the Spanish Government published in the Official State Gazette the Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 that includes a set of regulatory modifications applicable to the Spanish electricity sector and affecting the wind energy assets. According to these parameters, wind farms built in 2003 or earlier are not eligible to receive any incentive while newest farms will receive a flat premium per installed MW until the end of their regulatory life. The flat premium will be subject of tri-annual modifications due to updates in the forecast of the parameters affecting the profitability of the installations. Overall, the wind sector will receive 1,191 million of Euros in 2014 which compares to the forecast of 2,000 million of Euros that would have been received under the old regulation. These cut of approximately 800 million of Euros in wind sector represents a 45% of the total savings for the whole renewable sector that were estimated in 1,750 million of Euros in the budget published within the tariff and charges provided in Ministerial Order. The main regulatory modifications that Royal Decree-Law presents towards the Royal Decree-Law 661/2007 with impact in EDP Renováveis S.A. (EDPR) effective from 1 January 2013 onwards, are as follows: · Every energy production facilities operating under the special regime are to be remunerated according to current feed-in tariff schemes for the remaining useful life of the asset; · Energy production facilities operating under the special regime currently remunerated according to the market option were able to choose, until 15 February 2013 and for the remaining useful life of the asset, a remuneration based on the electricity wholesale market price with no renewable energy premium, and neither cap nor floor prices; · The index used to annually update all the regulated activities in the electricity sector is the annual inflation excluding energy products and food prices, and any impact of tax changes. The Spanish government disclosed the Energy Market Reform, which aims to end with the Spanish tariff deficit. The government claims that the reform may eliminate 4.5 billion of Euros/year of the structural deficit by: (i) 2.7 billion of Euros reduction in regulated costs of utilities and renewable energy source companies, and (ii) 0.9 billion of Euros contribution from the Spanish Treasury which will pay through the Budget 50% of the extra costs of generation in the non-mainland territories. The complete regulatory package will consist of: (i) a Royal Decree-Law (RD-L 9/2013, published in the Diário Oficial da União on 13 July), (ii) eight Decrees and Orders and (iii) the submission in the Parliament of the Project of Law ("Anteproyecto de Ley"). According to this RD-L 9/2013, renewable energy source plants will be subject to a new legal and economic framework: previous RD 661 framework will disappear and renewable energy source plants will receive the market price plus a payment per installed MW, so that the return on investment will be equivalent to the Spanish Government 10-year bonds yield plus a spread of 300 bps. This Royal Decree-Law also suppresses the renewables remuneration for reactive power (2/MWh). On 26 December 2013, the Spanish government published a new regulation that will govern the electricity sector (Law 24/2013) replacing the existing from 1997 (Law 54/1997). The government defines the new law's objective is to guarantee the supply of electricity and adapt to the consumer need at the lowest possible cost. It refers to the need to finish with the sector's structural deficit that that has been accumulated during the last decade as the motivation to undertake the reform. Regarding the renewable sector, the development of new installations will be conditioned to market needs, and their retribution will be based on market price with complementary revenues in order to ensure a reasonable return rate. Details on the renewable remuneration will be disclosed in the next months upon approval of the Royal Decree-Law for renewables, namely for wind farms and cogeneration assets. The Spanish Government published in 20 June 2014, the Order IET/1045/2014, which includes the parameters to remunerate the renewable energy assets, under the new remuneration framework that was approved by the Decree-Law 413/2014 of June 2014. The final legislation had no significant changes to the previous draft versions, which include the extension of wind farms scheme into operation in 2004, the increase of the remuneration per MW installed by 5%, and minor changes in methodology for the determination of the deviations from market prices. The remuneration is now structured in order for a standard asset to receive a pre-tax return defined as the yield of the Spanish 10-year bonds plus 300 bps. The return is based on the assets' regulatory life (20 years for wind energy assets). In the case of wind farms onshore, it has been confirmed that the wind farms in operation at 2003 and before will not receive any further incentive, while, while the incentive for the rest of the wind farms was calculated according to the new regulation in order to reach of 7.398% for a standard wind farm.       Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  171  EDP Renováveis expects that this regulatory change will have a total annual negative impact of approximately 30 million of Euros before tax (under an average windy year), when compared with the previous framework defined by Royal Decree-Law 2/2013. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN PORTUGAL The Portuguese legal provisions applicable to the generation of electrical power based on renewable resources are currently established by Decree-Law 189/88 dated 27 May, as amended by Decree-Law 168/99 dated 18 May, Decree-Law 312/2001 dated 10 December , and Decree-Law 339-C/2001 dated 29 December. Also relevant is Decree-Law 33-A/2005, dated 16 February ("DL 33-A/2005"), which establishes the current amounts used in the remuneration formula applicable to energy produced by means of renewable resources and the deadlines for the application of such remuneration formula. The Portuguese Government published on 28 February 2013, the Decree Law 35/2013, that maintains the legal stability of the current contracts (Decree-Law 33-A/2005) and protects the value of the investments made by the wind energy producers in the Portuguese economy. The wind farm producers can voluntarily invest to obtain further remuneration stability, through a new tariff scheme to be applied upon the actual 15 years established by law. The total investment will be used to reduce the overall costs of the Portuguese electricity system. In order to maximise the number of wind developers that voluntarily adheres to the extension of the remuneration framework, the Government proposed four alternative tariff schemes to be elected by each of the wind developers, that include the following conditions: i) alternative cap and floor selling prices; ii) alternative durations to the new scheme beyond the initial 15 years of the current contracts; and consequently iii) alternative levels of investment (on a per MW basis) to adhere a new scheme. EDPR has chosen a 7 year extension of the tariff defined as the average market price of previous twelve months, with a floor of 74/MWh and a cap of 98/MWh values updated with inflation from 2021 onwards, in exchange for a payment of 5.800/MW from 2013 to 2020. This decree also includes the possibility for wind farms under the new regime (i.e. ENEOP) to adhere to a similar scheme, still in negotiation. The Environment and Energy Ministry published, on 24 July, the Decree Law 94/2014 that allows the increase of installed capacity of wind farms up to 20%. The additional production generated from the capacity increase will have a fixed remuneration of 60 Euros/MWh, whilst the remaining production is remunerated at the previous tariff. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN FRANCE The electricity industry in France is governed primarily by Act 2000-108 (amended by Acts 2004-803 and 20061537) ("Act 2000'), passed on 10 February 2000, which governs the modernization and development of public energy services and is the general legislative framework for the operation of wind facilities in France. Act 2000 provides that, operator of wind facilities may enter into long-term agreements for the purchase and sale of energy with Electricité de France (EDF). The tariffs are set by Order of July 10, 2006 which was repealed in August 2008 due to formal defect in its approval, and then republished without any amendment in December 2008. The tariffs are the following: i) during the first ten years of the EDF Agreement, EDF pays a fixed annual tariff, which is 82 per MWh for applications made during 2006 (tariff is amended annually based, in part, on an inflation-related index); ii) During years 11 to 15 of the EDF Agreement, the tariff is based on the annual average percentage of energy produced during the wind facility' s first ten years. These tariffs are also amended annually, based, in part, on an inflation-related index; iii) Beginning in the year 16, there is no specific support structure and the wind energy generators will sell their electricity at market price. On March 2012, the legality of the 2008 feed-in tariff ministerial order for wind farm projects was questioned before the French Council of State (Conseil dÉtat) on the basis that the required notification to the European Commission on State Aid was missed. On 15 May, the French Council of State decided to raise the issue for a preliminary ruling before the EU Court of Justice (is expected 12 to 18 months to solve). In the event that the tariff is finally cancelled, the French government has urged the Council of State the postponement of this eventual ruling until 2013 onwards, thus, no retroactive effects are expected. After years of litigation, the French Council of State decided to cancel the French Wind Tariff on May 2014. The EU Court of Justice argued that it constituted illegal State Aid as France failed to notify the European Commission of the subsidy back in 2008. Shortly after, the French Government approved and released a new tariff decree ("Arrêté du 17 juin 2014") that had previously received clearance from the European Union. This new decree contains the same parameters than the former decree and has come into force with retroactive effects. Therefore, it will not endanger or modify any power purchase agreement signed under the 2008 Order. On 18 June, French energy minister unveiled a new law for a new energy model, which represents the culmination of a nation energy transition debate started in 2012. This new law sets targets to increase renewables production (32% for 2030 split between power (40%), heat (38%) and transport (15%)). New targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are also introduced (40% by 2030 compared to 1990). According to the law, nuclear dependence will also to be reduced, lowering its share to 50%. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA The United States federal government and various state governments have implemented policies designed to promote the growth of renewable energy, including wind power. The primary federal renewable energy incentive program is the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was established by the U.S. Congress as part of 1992 EPACT. Additionally, many states have passed legislation, principally in the form of renewable portfolio standards      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   172 172  172           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  ("RPS"), which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy supply from renewable sources, similar to the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes a number of energy related tax and policy provisions to benefit the development of wind energy generation, namely (i) a three year extension of the PTC until 2012 and (ii) an option to elect a 30% Investment Tax Credit ("ITC") that could replace the PTC through the duration of the extension. This ITC allows the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects placed in service or with the beginning of construction in 2009 and 2010. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment, Insurance and Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was approved and includes an one year extension of the ITC, which allow the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects with beginning of construction until December 2011 as long as placed in service until December 2012. On 16 December 2014, the U.S. Congress approved the "Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014" that included an extension of the PTC for wind, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit instead of the PTC. Congress set a new expiration date of 31 December 2014 and kept the qualification criteria (projects can qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2014). REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN POLAND The legislation applicable to renewable energy in Poland is primarily contained in an Energy Act passed on 10 April 1997, which has been amended by the Act of 24 July 2002 and the Energy Act of 2 April 2004, which came into effect in January 2005 (together, the ``Energy Act''). Pursuant to the Energy Act, power generation from renewable sources is supported. The following are forms of such support introduced in Poland: (i) A system of obligatory purchase of certificates of origin by the generation companies and trading companies selling electricity to the end user interconnected to a grid in Poland. These power companies are obliged to: a) obtain a certificate or origin and submit it to the ERA President for cancellation, or b) pay a substitute fee calculated in accordance with the Energy Act. ii) If the power company does not purchase certificates or origin or does not pay a substitute fee, the ERA President will penalize such company by the financial penalty calculated in accordance with the Energy Act. On 13 November 2013, the Polish Government disclosed a new renewable act draft introducing a tendering scheme for renewable capacity. Then, the Ministry of Economy published a second version of the law on renewables at 2 January 2014. The law is not expected to be applicable before 1 January 2016 as it will come into force on the first day of the month commencing after the lapse of 12 months following the issuance of a positive decision of the European Commission on the compliance of the state aid regulations. According to this draft, operating plants will be entitled to choose between remaining under the Green Certificate (GC) scheme and participating in tenders. This version has already been referred in the Permanent Committee of the Council of Ministers. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN BELGIUM The regulatory framework for electricity in Belgium is conditioned by the division of powers between the federal and the three regional entities: Wallonia, Flanders and Brussels-Capital. The federal regulatory field of competence includes electricity transmission (of transmission levels above 70 kV), generation, tariffs, planning and nuclear energy. The relevant federal legislation is the Electricity Act of 29 April 1999 (as modified) (the ``Electricity Act''). The regional regulatory entities are responsible for distribution, renewable energy and cogeneration (with the exception of offshore power plants) and energy efficiency. The relevant regional legislation, respectively, is: (a) for Flanders, the Electricity Decree of 17 July 2000; (b) for Wallonia, the Regional Electricity Market Decree of 12 April 2001; and (c) for Brussels-Capital, the Order of 19 July 2001 on the Organization of the Electricity Market. The Belgian regulatory system promotes the generation of electricity from renewable sources (and cogeneration) by a system of green certificates (each a ``GC''), as described below. The Belgian federal government is responsible for offshore power plants and for imposing obligations on the transmission system operators. The various GC systems are very similar across the three regions and are similar to the GC system for federallyregulated offshore power plants. There are currently differences in terms of quotas, fines and thresholds for granting GCs. On 21 March 2012, Walloon government approved a decree which fixes the quotas of GC until 2020. The new quotas are: (i) 19.4% in 2013; (ii) 23.1% in 2014; (iii) 26.7% in 2015; (iv) 30.4% in 2016. For the period from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2019, the yearly quotas will at the latest be fixed in 2014 on the basis of an evaluation carried out beforehand by the energy regulator of Wallonia (CWaPE). A new tax for wind generators has been approved in Wallonia last July. According to this regulation, all generators earning green certificates shall pay 0,54/MWh. The energy regulator of Wallonia (CWaPE) will be the beneficiary of this tax, aimed at supporting the costs originated by green certificates management. REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN ROMANIA The promotion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources in Romania was set with the Electricity Law 318/2003. In 2005 a Green Certificate mechanism was introduced with mandatory quotas for suppliers, in order to comply with their EU renewable requirements. The regulatory authority establishes a fixed quota of electricity produced from RES which suppliers are obliges to buy, and, annually reviews applications form green generators in order to be awarded green certificates. Law 220/2008 of November, introduced some changes in the green certificates system. In particular, it allows wind generators to receive 2GC/MWh until 2015. From 2016      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  173  onwards generators receive 1 green certificate for each MWh. The price of electricity is determined in the electricity market and the price of green certificates is determined on a separate market. The trading value of green certificates has a floor of 27 and a cap of 55, both indexed to Romanian inflation. Law 220/2008 also guarantees the access to the National Grid for the electricity produced from renewable sources. Law 220/2008 on renewable energy was amended by the Emergency Order 88/2011. A key aspect of this amendment was the overcompensation analysis which must be carried out on a yearly basis. ANRE shall monitor the producers benefiting from the support system and prepare annual reports on this regard. If overcompensation is found, ANRE will propose a reduction of the applicability period of the support scheme or the number of GCs initially granted to the technology. This reduction would be applied only to new plants. Law 123/2012 of 19 July 2012 on Electricity and Natural Gas eliminates the provision of bilateral contracts not publicly negotiated as a mean to sale electricity. Thus, trading of electricity must be carried out on a centralized market. On 4 September 2012, ANRE published the Order on Balancing Market. The new regulation has an impact for wind generation. On the one side, it states that for the energy reduced, the producer does not have the right to claim compensations for the loss of unproduced green certificates. This loss cannot be recovered. Also, new rules could result on larger balancing costs as the deficit price that wind generators have to face when the production is lower than the forecast may increase. The Romanian Parliament passed on 17 December 2013, the law for the approval of the Government Emergency Ordinance 57/2013 (the Ordinance). The law brings several amendments to the Ordinance and implicitly to the Renewables Law (i.e. Law 220/2008). The amendments are: - The postponement of Green Certificates of operating plants. The postponement will only apply to renewable energy operators accredited by ANRE before 2013. Wind power producers will receive 2 GCs/MWh until 2017 (inclusive) of which 1 GC will be postponed from trading between 1 July 2013 and 31 March 2017. Solar producers will see 2 GCs (out of 6 GCs) postponed from trading from 1 July 2013 and 31 March 2017. The GCs postponed will be gradually recovered until 31 December 2020 (starting on 1 April 2017 for solar PV and 1 January 2018 for wind); - Wind facilities accredited after this date will receive 1.5 GC/MWh until 2017 and 0.75 GC/MWh from 2018 onwards. All these GC will be immediately tradable; - Solar facilities will only receive 3 GC from 1 January 2014 onwards. On 24 March 2014, the President of Romania ratified EGO 57/2013 with the following amendments: (i) Reduction of the green certificates validity from 16 months to 12 months; and (ii) the obligation for National Agency for Energy Regulation (ANRE) to communicate in each year the GC quota for the next year. On 28 March 2014, the Romanian Official Gazette published a Government Decision containing the new green certificate quota for 2014 at a level of 11.1%. Additionally ANRE released on 27 June 2014, the 2015 mandatory quota for acquisition of green certificates at 11.9%, that as approved by the Government on 12 December 2014. In the Order 78/2014, of 14 August 2014, ANRE regulations on bilateral contracts market for electricity by approving a new regulation which no longer allows the use of flexible contracts and imposes strict compliance with the framework agreements to be prepared by OPCOM (Romania gas and electricity market operator). This order will entered into force on 1 January 2015. REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN ITALY On 6 July 2012, the Government approved the new renewable regulation by means of the Decree on Renewables (DM FER) based on feed-in-tariff support scheme. The key aspects of the new regulation provided by the DM FER are the following: (i) Wind farms over 5 MW will be remunerated under a feed-in tariff scheme defined by tenders; (ii) capacity to be tendered is set in different technologies' capacity paths (only set until 2015); (iii) the reference tariff for 2013 is 127 /MWh for onshore wind. Tender participants will bid offering discounts on a reference tariff (in %); (iv) The reference tariff will decrease 2% per year and will be granted for the whole average useful life of the renewable plant -20 years for onshore wind. The new system substitutes the previous one based on GCs. Under the previous system producers obtain their revenues from the sale of the electricity in the electricity market and from the sale of GCs. Wind farms built until December 2012 (with some exceptions) will continue to operate under the previous system until 2015 when the GC system will be transformed into a feed-in-premium. Spalma Incentivi Decree, published in November 2014, specifies that wind farms currently under the GCs scheme can voluntarily adhere to an extension of the incentivation period of 7 years in exchange of a permanent reduction of the premium/GCs received, the coefficient of reduction will be calculated individually for each wind farm depending on their remaining regulatory life. As the option is voluntary, wind farms which that refuse to accept this change would remain under current GCs scheme. Wind farms have to decide whether or not to adhere to the extension before 17 February 2015. REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN BRAZIL The Electrical Sector in Brazil is regulated by Federal Law nr 8,987 of 13 February 1995, which generally rules the concession and permission regime of public services; Law nr 9,074 of 7 July 1995, which rules the grant and extension of public services concession or permission contracts; Federal Law nr 10,438 of 26 April 2002, which governs the increase in Emergency Electric Power Supply and creates the 3,300 MW Program of Incentives for     Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   174 174  174           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A.

The Decree nr 5,025 of 30 March 2004, regulates the Federal Law nr 10,438 and states the "Alternative Energy Sources" economical and legal framework. PROINFA participants have granted a PPA with ELETROBRÁS, and are subject to the regulator (ANEEL) authority. However, the first stage of PROINFA has ended and the second stage is highly uncertain. After PROINFA program, renewable producers obtain their remuneration by participating in auctions where price is the only criteria. Winners of the auctions obtain a PPA contract at the price bid. Public Electricity Auctions are technically lead by the state "Energy Planning and Research Company" (EPE), who registers, analyses and allows potential participants.  02. ACCOUNTING POLICIES a) Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting records of EDP Renováveis, S.A. and consolidated entities. The consolidated annual accounts for 2014 and 2013 have been prepared to present fairly the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of EDP Renováveis, S.A. and subsidiaries at 31 December 2014 and 2013, the consolidated results of operations, consolidated cash flows and changes in consolidated equity for the years then ended. In accordance with Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, from the European Council and Parliament, the Group's consolidated annual accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and its predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and its predecessor bodies. The Board of Directors approved these consolidated annual accounts on 24 February 2015. The annual accounts are presented in thousands of Euros, rounded to the nearest thousand. The annual accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the application of fair value basis for derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading and available-forsale, except those for which a reliable measure of fair value is not available. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the IFRS-EU requires the Board of Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and of the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors considered reasonable in accordance with the circumstances. They form the basis for making judgments regarding the values of the assets and liabilities whose valuation is not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving the highest degree of judgment or complexity, or for which the assumptions and estimates are considered significant, are disclosed in note 3 - Critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies. Accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group companies and in all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Nevertheless, the first time adoption of IFRS 10 and 11 with effective date of 1 January 2014, implied the Group to apply this standard for comparative purposes for the annual period immediately preceding, which is 1 January 2013. b) Basis of consolidation Controlled entities Investments in subsidiaries where the Group has control are fully consolidated from the date the Group assumes control over their financial and operating activities until the moment that control ceases to exist. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, independently of the percentage of voting rights held. Joint arrangements The Group classifies an arrangement as a joint arrangement when the jointly control is contractually established. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, independently of the percentage of voting rights held. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that collectively control the arrangement. After determining the existence of joint control, the Group classifies joint arrangements into two types - joint operations and joint ventures. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint operators) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, so the assets and liabilities (and related revenues and expenses) in relation to its interest in the arrangement are recognised and measured in accordance with relevant IFRSs applicable.     Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  175  A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint venturers) have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, so this investment shall be accounted for using the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of joint ventures, accounted for under the equity method. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in a jointly controlled entity, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of that entity. Entities over which the Group has significant influence Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method from the date the Group acquires significant influence to the date it ceases. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its financial and operating policies. The existence of significant influence by the Group is usually evidenced by one or more of the following: - Representation on the Executive Board of Directors or equivalent governing body of the investee; - Participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends and other distributions; - Existence of material transactions between the Group and the investee; - Interchange of managerial personnel; - Provision of essential technical information. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of associates, accounted for under the equity method. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of the associate. Business combination From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable. Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: · The fair value of the consideration transferred; plus · The recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus · If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less · The net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. Some business combinations in the period have been determined provisionally as the Group is currently in the process of measuring the fair value of the net assets acquired. The identifiable net assets have therefore initially been recognised at their provisional value. Adjustments during the measurement period have been recorded as if they had been known at the date of the combination and comparative information for the prior year has been restated where applicable. Adjustments to provisional values only include information relating to events and circumstances existing at the acquisition date and which, had they been known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. After that period, adjustments to initial measurement are only made to correct an error. Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   176 176  176           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group's interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition. Accounting for acquisitions of non-controlling interests From 1 January 2010, acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Previously, goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary, which represented the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of the transaction. Investments in foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, are translated to Euro at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity. Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Inter-company balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities. Common control transactions The accounting for transactions among entities under common control is excluded from IFRS 3. Consequently, in the absence of specific guidance, within IFRSs, the EDP Renováveis Group has developed an accounting policy for such transactions, as considered appropriate. According to the Group's policy, business combinations among entities under common control are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the EDP consolidated book values of the acquired company (subgroup). The difference between the carrying amount of the net assets received and the consideration paid, is recognised in equity. Put options related to non-controlling interests EDP Renováveis Group records written put options at the date of acquisition of a business combination or at a subsequent date as an advance acquisition of these interests, recording a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, irrespective of the estimated probability that the options will be exercised. The difference between this amount and the amount corresponding to the percentage of the interests held in the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Until 31 December 2009, in years subsequent to initial recognition, the changes in the liability due to the effect of the financial discount are recognised as a financial expense in the consolidated income statement, and the remaining changes are recognised as an adjustment to the cost of the business combination. Where applicable, dividends paid to minority shareholders up to the date the options are exercised are also recorded as adjustments to the cost of the business combination. In the event that the options are not exercised, the transaction would be recorded as a sale of interests to minority shareholders. As from January 2010, the Group applies IAS 27 (2008) to new put options related to non-controlling interests and there subsequent changes in the carrying amount of the put liability are recognised in profit or loss. c) Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013       CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  177  on the retranslation of available-for-sale equity instruments, a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. d) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trade date at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value of derivative financial instruments is re-measured on a regular basis, being the gains or losses on re-measurement recognised directly in the income statement, except for derivatives designated as hedging instruments. The recognition of the resulting gains or losses on re-measurement of the derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the risk being hedged and of the hedge model used. The fair value of derivatives correspond to their quoted market prices as provided by an exchange, or is determined by through the use of net present value techniques, including discounted cash flows models and option pricing models, as appropriate. Hedge accounting The Group uses financial instruments to hedge interest and foreign exchange risks resulting from its operational and financing activities. The derivate financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded as for trading. The derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, being the gains and losses recognised in accordance with the hedge accounting model adopted by the Group. Hedge accounting is used when: (i) At the inception of the hedge, the hedge relationship is identified and documented; (ii) The hedge is expected to be highly effective; (iii) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; (iv) The hedge is revalued on an on-going basis and is considered to be highly effective over the reporting period; and (v) The forecast transactions hedged are highly probable and represent a risk to changes in cash flows that could affect the income statement. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge model is recognised in equity. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship are recognised in the income statement in the moment they occur. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in equity are also reclassified to the income statement over the periods in which the hedged item will affect the income statement. When the forecast transaction hedge results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains or losses recorded in equity are included in the acquisition cost of the asset. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity at that time stays recognised in equity until the hedged transaction also affects the income statement. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses recognized in equity are recorded in the income statement. Net investment hedge The net investment hedge is applied on a consolidated basis to investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies. The exchange differences recorded against exchange differences arising on consolidation are offset by the exchange differences arising from the foreign currency borrowings used for the acquisition of those subsidiaries. If the hedging instrument is a derivative, the gains or losses arising from fair value changes are also recorded against exchange differences arising on consolidation. The ineffective portion of the hedging relation is recognised in the income statement. e) Other financial assets The Group classifies its other financial assets at acquisition date in the following categories: Loans and receivable Loans and receivable are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently are measured at amortised cost less impairment losses. Impairment losses are recorded based on the valuation of estimated losses from non-collection of loans and receivable at the balance sheet date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, and can be reversed if the estimated losses decrease in a later period.      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   178 178  178           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category includes: (i) financial assets held for trading, which are those acquired for the purpose of being traded in the short term, and (ii) financial assets that are designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale and that are not classified in any of the other categories. The Group's investments in equity securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition Purchases and sales of: (i) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and (ii) available-for-sale investments, are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, in which case these transaction costs are directly recognised in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when: (i) the contractual rights to receive their cash flows have expired, (ii) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership or (iii) although retaining some, but not substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, the Group has transferred the control over the assets. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Available-for-sale financial assets are also subsequently carried at fair value. However, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the financial assets are derecognised or impaired. When this occurs, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity are immediately recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange differences arising from equity investments classified as available-for-sale are also recognised in equity. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method and dividends, are recognised in the income statement. The fair values on quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. For unlisted securities the Group determines the fair value through: (i) valuation techniques, including the use of recent arm's length transactions or discounted cash flow analysis and (ii) valuation assumptions based on market information. Financial instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost. Reclassifications between categories The Group does not reclassify, after initial recognition, a financial instrument into or out of the fair value through profit or loss category. Impairment At each balance sheet date, an assessment is performed as to whether there is objective evidence of impairment, including any impairment resulting in an adverse effect on estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the recoverable amount of the financial asset is determined, and the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after their initial recognition, such as: (i) in the case of listed securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the listed price of the security, and (ii) in the case of unlisted securities, when that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated amount of the future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated. Evaluating the existence of objective evidence of impairment involves judgement, in which case the Group considers, among other factors, price volatility and current economic situation. Thus, when listed securities are concerned, it is considered as continuous a devaluation in the listed price of the security for a period over 24 months and as significant a devaluation of the security's value above 40%. If there is objective evidence of impairment on available-for-sale investments, the cumulative potential loss recognised in fair values reserves, corresponding to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value at the balance sheet date, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred to the income statement. f) Financial liabilities An instrument is classified as a financial liability when it contains a contractual obligation to transfer cash or another financial asset, independently from its legal form. These financial liabilities are recognised (i) initially at fair value less transaction costs and (ii) subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  179  The Group derecognises the whole or part of a financial liability when the obligations included in the contract have been satisfied or the Group is legally released of the fundamental obligation related to this liability either through a legal process or by the creditor. g) Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. To the extent that funds are borrowed generally, the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation are determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on these assets. The capitalisation rate corresponds to the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the enterprise that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during a period does not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during the period. The capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when expenditures for the asset are being incurred, borrowing costs have been incurred and activities necessary to prepare all or part of the assets for their intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use or sale are completed. Capitalisation of borrowing costs shall be suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted. h) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. The cost of acquisition includes interest on external financing and personnel costs and other internal expenses directly or indirectly related to work in progress accrued solely during the period of construction. The cost of production is capitalised by charging costs attributable to the asset as own work capitalised under financial expenses and personnel costs and employee benefit expense in the consolidated income statement. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent costs are recognised as separate assets only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. All repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. The Group assesses assets impairment, whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the impairment being recognised in the income statement. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on the other assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Buildings and other constructions Plant and machinery: - Wind farm generation - Other plant and machinery Transport equipment Office equipment and tools Other tangible fixed assets i) Intangible assets The other intangible assets of the Group are booked at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group does not own intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Group assesses for impairment, whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the impairment being recognised in the income statement. Acquisition and development of software Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives. Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable specific software applications by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include employee costs directly associated with the development of the referred software and are amortised using the straight-line method during their expected useful lives.     Number of years 8 to 40 25 4 to 25 3 to 5 2 to 10 3 to 10  Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   180 180  180           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  Maintenance costs of software are charged to the income statement when incurred. Industrial property and other rights The amortisation of industrial property and other rights is calculated using the straight-line method for an expected useful live expected of less than 6 years. Green Certificates As a consequence of the regulatory changes in Romania there's a new category of Green Certificates (GCs) which although granted are restricted for sale until 2017 (solar) and 2018 (wind). These deferred GCs are recognised as intangible assets when generated at fair market value. These GCs will be offset as they will be collected. Power purchase agreements Acquired Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are booked as intangible assets and amortised using the straightline method according with the duration of the contract. j) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is then estimated. For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the cash-generating unit). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in circumstances that caused the impairment. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. k) Leases The Group classifies its lease agreements as finance leases or operating leases taking into consideration the substance of the transaction rather than its legal form. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating leases Lease payments are recognised as an expense and charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate. l) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of the acquisition cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes purchases, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated selling costs. The cost of inventories is assigned by using the weighted average method. m) Classification of assets and liabilities as current and non-current The Group classifies assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as current and noncurrent. Current assets and liabilities are determined as follows: Assets are classified as current when they are expected to be realised or are intended for sale or consumption in the Group's normal operating cycle, they are held primarily for the purpose of trading, they are expected to be realised within twelve months of the balance sheet date or are cash or a cash equivalent, unless the assets may not be exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities are classified as current when they are expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle, they are held primarily for the purpose of trading, they are due to be settled within twelve months of the balance      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  181  sheet date or the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Financial liabilities are classified as current when they are due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, even if the original term was for a period longer than twelve months, and an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the reporting period and before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue. n) Provisions Provisions are recognised when: (i) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, (ii) it is probable that settlement will be required in the future and (iii) a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Dismantling and decommissioning provisions The Group recognises dismantling and decommissioning provisions for property, plant and equipment when a legal or contractual obligation is settled to dismantling and decommissioning those assets at the end of their useful life. Consequently, the Group has booked provisions for property, plant and equipment related with wind turbines, for the expected cost of restoring sites and land to its original condition. The provisions correspond to the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation and are recognised as part of the initial cost or an adjustment to the cost of the respective asset, being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the asset useful life. The assumptions used are: Average cost per MW (Euros) Salvage value per MW (Euros) Discount rate Euro PLN USD CAD RON Inflation rate Euro zone Poland USA Canada Capitalisation (number of years) EDPR EU 14,000 41,000 [1.90% - 2.50%] [3.00% - 4.00%] [4.50% - 5.65%] [1.75% - 1.85%] 0.90% 25 EDPR NA 19,768 28,828 [3.85% - 5.00%] [3.35% - 4.25%] 2.50% 2.25% 25  Decommissioning and dismantling provisions are remeasured on an annual basis based on the best estimate of the settlement amount. The unwinding of the discount at each balance sheet date is charged to the income statement. o) Recognition of costs and revenue Costs and revenues are recorded in the year to which they refer regardless of when paid or received, in accordance with the accrual concept. Differences between amounts received and paid and the corresponding revenue and expenditure are recorded under other assets and other liabilities. Revenue comprises the amounts invoiced on the sale of products or of services rendered, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts, after elimination of intra-group sales. Revenue from energy sales is recognised in the period that energy is generated and transferred to customers. Deferred Green Certificates (GCs) are recognised as revenue at fair market value. p) Financial results Financial results include interest payable on borrowings, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, unwinding of the discount of provisions and written put options to non-controlling interests, foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on financial instruments and the accrual of tax equity estimated interest over outstanding liability. Interest income is recognised in the income statement based on the effective interest rate method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity's right to receive payments is established. q) Income tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   182 182  182           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. r) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding the average number of ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury stock. s) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include balances with maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition, including cash and deposits in banks. This caption also includes other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and specific demand deposits in relation to institutional partnerships that are funds required to be held in escrow sufficient to pay the remaining construction related costs of projects in institutional equity partnerships in U.S.A., in the next twelve months. t) Government grants Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income under non-current liabilities when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. u) Environmental issues The Group takes measures to prevent, reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its activities. Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as other operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred. v) Institutional partnerships in U.S. wind farms The Group has entered in several partnerships with institutional investors in the United States, through limited liability company operating agreements that apportion the cash flows generated by the wind farms between the investors and the Company and allocates the tax benefits, which include Production Tax Credits (PTCs), Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and accelerated depreciation, largely to the investor. The institutional investors purchase their minority partnership interests for an upfront cash payment with an agreed targeted internal rate of return over the period that the tax credits are generated. This anticipated return is computed based on the total anticipated benefit that the institutional investors will receive and includes the value of PTC's / ITC's, allocated taxable income or loss and cash distributions received. The control and management of these wind farms are a responsibility of EDPR Group and they are fully consolidated in these financial statements. The upfront cash payment received is recognised under `Liabilities arising from institutional partnerships' and subsequently measured at amortised cost. This liability is reduced by the value of tax benefits provided and cash distributions made to the institutional investors during the contracted period. The value of the tax benefits delivered, primarily accelerated depreciation and ITC are recognized as Income from institutional partnerships on a pro-rata basis over the 25 year useful life of the underlying projects (see note 7). The value of the PTC's delivered are recorded as generated. After the Flip Date, the institutional investor retains a small non-controlling interest for the duration of its membership in the structure. The non-controlling interest is entitled to cash distribution and income allocation percentages varying from 2.5% to 6.0%, with the exception of Vento VI in which the institutional investor is allocated 17.0% of income. EDPR NA also has an option to purchase the institutional investor's residual interest at fair market value on the Flip Date for PTC flip structures and generally, six months after the later of the 5-year anniversary of final turbine commissioning date or the Flip Date, or ten years after the final funding date if the Flip Date has not yet occurred. The liability for residual interest is accreted on a straight line basis from the funding date through the Flip Date to reflect the institutional investors' minority interest position in the EDPR Group at the Flip Date.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES The IFRS set forth a range of accounting treatments and require the Board of Directors to apply judgment and make estimates in deciding which treatment is most appropriate. The main accounting estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies are discussed in this note in order to improve the understanding of how their application affects the Group's reported results and disclosures. A broader description of the accounting policies employed by the Group is disclosed in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although estimates are calculated by the Board of Directors based on the best information available at 31 December 2014 and 2013, future events may require changes to these estimates in subsequent years. Any effect on the financial statements of adjustments to be made in subsequent years would be recognised prospectively. Considering that in many cases there are alternatives to the accounting treatment adopted by EDP Renováveis, the Group's reported results could differ if a different treatment was chosen. EDP Renováveis believes that the choices made are appropriate and that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, the Group's financial position and results. The alternative outcomes discussed below are presented solely to assist the reader in understanding the financial statements and are not intended to suggest that other alternatives or estimates would be more appropriate. Fair value of derivatives Fair values are based on listed market prices, if available, otherwise fair value is determined either by dealer prices (both for that transaction or for similar instruments traded) or by pricing models, based on net present value of estimated future cash flows which take into account market conditions for the underlying instruments, time value, yield curves and volatility factors. These pricing models may require assumptions or judgments in estimating fair values. Consequently, the use of a different model or of different assumptions or judgments in applying a particular model may have produced different financial results for a particular period. Review of the useful life of assets related to production. The Group regularly reviews the useful life of its electrical generation installations in order to bring it into line with the technical and economic measurements of the installations, taking into consideration their technological capacity and prevailing regulatory restrictions. Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment test are performed whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets is less than the corresponding net book value of assets. On an annual basis, the Group reviews the assumptions used to assess the existence of impairment in goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shares in subsidiaries. The assumptions used are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic indicators and business assumptions used by management. The net interest in associates is reviewed when circumstances indicate the existence of impairment. Considering that estimated recoverable amounts related to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are based on the best information available, changes in the estimates and judgments could change the impairment test results which could affects the Group's reported results. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant interpretations and estimates are required in determining the global amount for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Different interpretations and estimates would result in a different level of income taxes, current and deferred, recognised in the period. Tax Authorities are entitled to review EDP Renováveis, and its subsidiaries' determination of its annual taxable earnings, for a determined period that may be extended in case there are tax losses carried forward. Therefore, it is possible that some additional taxes may be assessed, mainly as a result of differences in interpretation of the tax law. However, the EDP Renováveis and its subsidiaries, do not anticipate any significant changes to the income tax booked in the financial statements.       Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   184 184  184           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  Dismantling and decommissioning provisions The Board of Directors considers that Group has contractual obligations with the dismantling and decommissioning of property, plant and equipment related to wind electricity generation. For these responsibilities the Group has recorded provisions for the expected cost of restoring sites and land to its original condition. The provisions correspond to the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. The use of different assumptions in estimates and judgments referred may have produced different results from those that have been considered. Green Certificates As a consequence of the regulatory changes in Romania related to Green Certificates (GCs), the Group has the following assumptions: (i) For estimating the price of GCs, the model is based on current regulation including the latest developments published in the last months and estimations on renewable capacity to be added in the following years; (ii) Our GC model determines whether there will be excess or deficit of GCs to evaluate the price to apply; "In order to determine whether there will be excess or deficit of GCs, we compare demand with supply of GCs. Demand of GCs is calculated by multiplying gross electricity consumption and quotas of renewable electricity. Electricity demand growth is based in latest external estimates, including those from Romanian regulator ANRE. EDPR has made sensitivity analyses to the quotas and has assumed a conservative scenario that considers the latest regulatory changes. Regarding supply of GCs, starting from year-end 2014 renewables installed capacity, EDPR assumes capacity additions in line with latest market view on renewables development in the country. Entities included in the consolidation perimeter In order to determine which entities must be included in the consolidation perimeter, the Group evaluates whether it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. This evaluation requires judgement, assumptions and estimates in order to conclude whether the Group is in fact exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Other assumptions and estimates could lead to a different consolidation perimeter of the Group, with direct impact in the consolidated financial statements.  04. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES The businesses of EDP Renováveis Group are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in market prices, foreign exchange and interest rates. The main financial risks lie essentially in its debt portfolio, arising from interest-rate and the exchange-rate exposures. The unpredictability of the financial markets is analysed on an on-going basis in accordance with the EDPR's risk management policy. Financial instruments are used to minimize potential adverse effects resulting from the interest rates and foreign exchange rates risks on EDP Renováveis financial performance. The Board of Directors of EDP Renováveis is responsible for the definition of general risk-management principles and the establishment of exposure limits. The management of financial risks of EDP Renováveis Group is outsourced to the Finance Department of EDP - Energias de Portugal, S.A., in accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The outsourcing service includes identification and evaluation of hedging mechanisms appropriate to each exposure. All transactions undertaken using derivative financial instruments require the prior approval of the Board of Directors, which defines the parameters of each transaction and approves the formal documents describing their objectives. Exchange-rate risk management EDP Group's Financial Department is responsible for managing the foreign exchange exposure of the Group, seeking to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets and net profits of the Group, using foreign exchange derivatives, foreign exchange debt and/or other hedging structures with symmetrical exposure characteristics to those of the hedged item. The effectiveness of these hedges is reassessed and monitored throughout their lives. EDPR operates internationally and is exposed to the exchange-rate risk resulting from investments in foreign subsidiaries. With the objective of minimizing the impact of exchange rates fluctuations, EDP Renováveis general policy is to fund each project in the currency of the operating cash flows generated by the project. Currently, the main currency exposure is the U.S. Dollar, resulting from the shareholding in EDPR NA. With the increasing capacity in other geographies, EDPR is also becoming exposed to other currencies (Brazilian Real, Zloty, New Romanian Leu and Canadian Dollar). To hedge the risk originated with net investment in EDPR NA, EDP Renováveis entered into a CIRS in USD/EUR with EDP Branch and also uses financial debt expressed in USD. Following the same strategy adopted to hedge      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  185  these investments in USA, EDP Renováveis has also entered into CIRS in BRL/EUR and in PLN/EUR to hedge the investments in Brazil and Poland (see note 35). Sensitivity analysis - Foreign exchange rate As a consequence a depreciation/appreciation of 10% in the foreign currency exchange rate, with reference to 31 December 2014 and 2013, would originate an increase/(decrease) in EDP Renováveis Group income statement and equity before taxes, as follows: Profit or loss +10% 5,825 5,825 Profit or loss +10% 3,778 3,778 31 Dec 2014 -10% -7,119 -7,119 31 Dec 2013 -10% -4,617 -4,617 Equity +10% Equity +10% -  Thousands of Euros USD / EUR  -10% -  Thousands of Euros USD / EUR  -10% -  This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely interest rates, remain unchanged. Interest rate risk management The Group's operating cash flows are substantially independent from the fluctuation in interest-rate markets. The purpose of the interest-rate risk management policies is to reduce the exposure of debt cash flows to market fluctuations. As such, whenever considered necessary and in accordance to the Group's policy, the Group contracts derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks. In the floating-rate financing context, the Group contracts interest-rate derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows associated with future interest payments, which have the effect of converting floating rate loans into fixed rate loans. All these hedges are undertaken on liabilities in the Group's debt portfolio and are mainly perfect hedges with a high correlation between changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the interest-rate risk or upcoming cash flows. The EDP Renováveis Group has a portfolio of interest-rate derivatives with maturities up to 12 years. The Financial Department of EDP Group undertakes sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest-rate fluctuations or upcoming cash flows. About 92% of EDP Renováveis Group financial debt bear interest at fixed rates, considering operations of hedge accounting with financial instruments. Sensitivity analysis - Interest rates The management of interest rate risk associated to activities developed by the Group is outsourced to the Financial Department of EDP Group, contracting derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk. Based on the debt portfolio of the EDPR EU Group and the related derivative financial instruments used to hedge associated interest rate risk, as well as on the shareholder loans received by EDP Renováveis, a change of 50 basis points in the interest rates with reference to 31 December 2014 and 2013 would increase/(decrease) in EDP Renováveis Group income statement and equity before taxes, as follows: 31 Dec 2014 Profit or loss Equity + 50 bps - 50 bps + 50 bps 12,343 -1,094 -1,094 1,094 1,094 31 Dec 2013 12,343 Equity + 50 bps 19,389 19,389  Thousands of Euros Cash flow hedge derivatives Unhedged debt (variable interest rates)  - 50 bps -12,844 -12,844  Thousands of Euros Cash flow hedge derivatives Unhedged debt (variable interest rates)  Profit or loss + 50 bps - 50 bps -687 -687 687 687  - 50 bps -20,973 -20,973  This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely foreign exchange rates, remain unchanged.

AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  Counter-party credit-rate risk management in financial transactions The EDP Renováveis Group policy in terms of the counterparty risk on financial transactions with companies outside EDP Group is managed by an analysis of the technical capacity, competitiveness, credit rating and exposure to each counter-party. Counterparties in derivatives and financial transactions are restricted to highquality credit institutions or to the EDP Group. The EDP Renováveis Group documents financial operations according to international standards. Most derivative financial instruments contracted with credit institutions are engaged under ISDA Master Agreements. In the specific case of the EDPR EU Group, credit risk is not significant due to the limited average collection period for customer balances and the quality of its debtors. The Group's main customers are operators and distributors in the energy market of their respective countries (OMIE and MEFF in the case of the Spanish market). In the specific case of EDPR NA Group, credit risk is not significant due to the limited average collection period for customer balances and the quality of its debtors. The Group's main customers are regulated utility companies and regional market agents in the U.S. EDP Renováveis believes that the amount that best represents the Group's exposure to credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of Trade receivables and Other debtors, net of the impairment losses recognised. The Group believes that the credit quality of these receivables is adequate and that no significant impaired credits exist that have not been recognised as such and provided for. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the possibility that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group strategy to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have significant liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. The liquidity policy followed ensures compliance with payment obligations acquired, through maintaining sufficient credit facilities and having access to the EDP Group facilities. The EDP Renováveis Group undertakes management of liquidity risk through the engagement and maintenance of credit lines and financing facilities with its main shareholder, as well as directly in the market with national and international financial institutions, assuring the necessary funds to perform its activities. Market price risk As at 31 December 2014, market price risk affecting the EDP Renováveis Group is not significant. In the case of EDPR NA, the great majority of the plants are under power purchase agreements, with fixed or escalating prices. In the case of EDPR EU, the electricity is sold in Spain through regulated tariffs. In the remaining countries, prices are mainly determined through regulated tariffs except for Romania and Poland, where most plants are under power purchase agreements with fixed prices or floors. For the small share of energy generated with market exposure, this risk is managed through electricity sales swaps. EDPR EU and EDPR NA have electricity sales swaps that qualify for hedge accounting (cash flow hedge) that are related to electricity sales for the years 2014 to 2018 (see note 35). The purpose of EDP Renováveis Group is to hedge a volume of energy generated to reduce its exposure to the energy price volatility. Capital management The Group's goal in managing equity, in accordance with the policies established by its main shareholder, is to safeguard the Group's capacity to continue operating as a going concern, grow steadily to meet established growth targets and maintain an optimum equity structure to reduce equity cost. In conformity with other sector groups, the Group controls its financing structure based on the leverage ratio. This ratio is calculated as net financial borrowings divided by total equity and net borrowings. Net financial borrowings are determined as the sum of financial debt, institutional equity liabilities corrected for non-current deferred revenues, less cash and cash equivalents.  05.

Losses may be used to offset yearly taxable income and if not fully utilized, may be carried forward to be set off against company's taxable profits for: 5 years in Poland; 7 years in Romania; 9 years in the Netherlands; 12 years in Portugal and indefinitely in Spain, France, Italy, Belgium and Brazil (although limited to 30% of the company's yearly taxable income in this latter case). Whenever possible and allowed by the tax legislation of the country in which the Group entities are incorporated, companies opt for the formation of a tax consolidation regime, thus being taxed on a consolidated basis instead of on an individual basis. EDP Renováveis S.A. and its subsidiaries file individual tax declarations in accordance with applicable tax legislation. Nevertheless, the company and the majority of its Spanish subsidiaries pay corporate income tax following the specific principles of the Tax Consolidation Regime, contained in articles 64 and 82 of Law 27/2014 of 27 November 2014, which amended the Corporate Income Tax Code. The companies of EDPR Group in Spain are included in the Tax consolidation perimeter of EDP, S.A. - Sucursal en España (EDP Branch).

Therefore, the Group recognised deferred tax assets of 14.2 million of Euros benefiting from a tax credit for the period ended 31 December 2013, net of an upfront fee ("gravamen único") that amounted to 2.4 million of Euros, corresponding to 5% of the revaluation revenue.  15.

In the case of operational wind farms, it is performed by determining the recoverable value through the value in use. Goodwill is allocated to each country where EDPR Group performs its activity, so the EDPR Group aggregate all the CGUs cash flows in each country in order to calculate the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated. To perform this analysis, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method was used. This method is based on the principle that the estimated value of an entity or business is defined by its capacity to generate financial resources in the future, assuming these can be removed from the business and distributed among the company's shareholders, without compromising the maintenance of the activity. Therefore, for the businesses developed by EDPR's CGUs, the valuation was based on free cash flows generated by the business, discounted at appropriate discount rates. The future cash flows projection period used is the useful life of the assets (25 years) which is consistent with the current depreciation method. The cash flows also incorporate the long-term off-take contract in place and longterm estimates of power prices, whenever the asset holds merchant exposure.

AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  199  The main assumptions used for the impairment tests are as follows: - Power produced: net capacity factors used for each CGU utilize the wind studies carried out, which takes into account the long-term predictability of wind output and that wind generation is supported in nearly all countries by regulatory mechanisms that allow for production and priority dispatching whenever weather conditions permit; - Electricity remuneration: regulated or contracted remuneration has been applied where available, as for the CGUs that benefit from regulated remuneration or that have signed contracts to sell their output during all or part of their useful life; where this is not available, prices were derived using price curves projected by the company based on its experience, internal models and using external data references; - New capacity: tests were based on the best information available on the wind farms expected to be built in coming years, adjusted by probability of success and by the growth prospects of the company based on the Business Plan Targets, its historical growth and market size projections. The tests considered the contracted and expected prices to buy turbines from various suppliers; - Operating costs: established contracts for land leases and maintenance agreements were used; other operating costs were projected consistent with the company's experience and internal models; - Terminal value: considered as a 15% of the initial investment in each wind farm, considering inflation; - Discount rate: the discount rates used are post-tax, reflect EDPR Group's best estimate of the risks specific to each CGU and range as follows: Europe United States Brazil 2014 4.0% - 6.4% 5.1% - 7.1% 8.6% - 10.3% 2013 4.8% - 7.6% 6.0% - 7.3% 8.6% - 9.9%  Impairment tests done have taken into account the regulation changes in each country, as disclosed in note 1. EDPR has performed a series of sensitivity analyses of the results of impairment tests to reasonable changes in some of the key variables, such as: - EDPR NA, decrease in the Net Capacity Factors; - EDPR NA, 5% and 10% reduction of Merchant Prices. Furthermore, EDPR Group has done an additional sensitivity analysis increasing 100 basis points the discount rate used in case base for EDPR EU and EDPR Brasil CGU's. These sensitivity analyses performed for each assumption independently would not suppose any impairment for the goodwill allocated to each country.  18.

Cash flow hedge power price swaps are related to the hedging of the sales price. EDPR NA has entered into a power price swap to hedge the variability in the spot market prices received for a portion of the production of Maple Ridge I project. Additionally, both EDPR NA and EDPR EU have entered in short term hedges to hedge the short term volatility of certain un-contracted generation of its wind farms. In certain U.S. power markets, EDPR NA is exposed to congestion and line loss risks which typically have a negative impact on the price received for power generated in these markets. To economically hedge these risk exposures, EDPR NA entered into Financial Transmission Rights ("FTR") and a three year fixed for floating Locational Marginal Price (LMP) swap. The trading derivative financial instruments are derivatives contracted for economic hedging that are not eligible for hedge accounting. These include a USD/EUR forward contract with EDP Servicios Financieros used to mitigate the exchange rate risk arising from the net assets in USD, as a complement of the net investment hedge. Fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on quotes indicated by external entities. These entities use discount cash flows techniques usually accepted and data from public markets. As such, according to IFRS13 requirements, the fair value of the derivative financial instruments is classified as of Level 2 (note 38).

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Fair value of financial instruments is based, whenever available, on quoted market prices. Otherwise, fair value is determined through internal models, which are based on generally accepted cash flow discounting techniques and option valuation models or through quotations supplied by third parties. Non-standard instruments may require alternative techniques, which consider their characteristics and the generally accepted market practices applicable to such instruments. These models are developed considering the market variables that affect the underlying instrument, namely yield curves, exchange rates and volatility factors. Market data is obtained from generally accepted suppliers of financial data (Bloomberg and Reuters).

The financial instruments for which reliable fair value estimates are not available, are recorded in the statement of financial position at their cost. Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and suppliers These financial instruments include mainly short term financial assets and liabilities.

At the reporting date, the carrying amount of floating rate loans is approximately their fair value. In case of fixed rate loans, mainly the intercompany loans granted by EDP Group, their fair value is obtained through internal models based on generally accepted discounting techniques. Derivative financial instruments All derivatives are accounted at their fair value. For those which are quoted in organized markets, the respective market price is used. For over-the-counter derivatives, fair value is estimated through the use of internal models based on cash flow discounting techniques and option valuation models generally accepted by the market, or by dealer price quotations.

RELEVANT AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS EDPR executes a new asset rotation transaction in the US During the third quarter of 2014, EDP Renováveis S.A. (EDPR) has reached an agreement with Fiera Axium Infrastructure U.S. L.P. (Fiera Axium) to sell a minority cash equity interest in a U.S. wind portfolio with a total production capacity of 1,101 MW. Fiera Axium's interest in the portfolio will represent 394.5 MW and is the second asset rotation transaction announced by EDPR with Fiera Axium, further strengthening the existing partnership. The portfolio is comprised of 9 operating wind farms. All of the wind farms have long-term offtake agreements in place. Based on i) the transaction price and ii) the expected tax equity liabilities of the projects, the total enterprise value on the 1,101 MW portfolio amounts to U.S. 1.7 billion of U.S. Dollar translating to 1.54 million of U.S. Dollar/MW. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. The offer contemplates an initial funding to occur upon obtaining regulatory approvals and a final funding to occur upon achievement of commercial operations of the assets under construction. Acquisition by EDPR of 45% of the share capital of EDP Renováveis Brasil In November 2014, EDP Renováveis, S.A. and EDP Energias do Brasil (EDP Brasil) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding envisaging the acquisition by EDPR of 45% of the share capital of EDP Renováveis Brasil, S.A. controlled by EDP Brasil. Following this transaction EDPR will control 100% of the share capital of EDPR Brasil. EDPR Brasil operates 84 MW of wind energy and has in execution 237 MW of wind energy projects with longterm power purchase agreements (PPAs) awarded in the 2011 and 2013 energy auctions. EDPR announces the sale of minority stakes in wind farms in Brazil to CTG In December 2014, EDP Renováveis, S.A. through its subsidiary EDPR Brasil entered into an agreement with CWEI (Brasil) Participações Ltda, a subsidiary of CTG to sell an equity shareholding of 49% in both operational and under development wind farms in Brasil. The transaction scope covers 84 MW in operation, as mentioned above, with an average age of 4 years, as well as 237 MW under development, remunerated according to longterm awarded contracts to sell the electricity produced for 20 years. EDP Renováveis executes project finance for 120 MW in Brazil On 26 January 2015, EDP Renováveis, S.A. (EDPR) has executed project finance structure agreements with the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) for the Baixa do Feijão project, which comprises four wind farms with a total capacity of 120 MW. The Baixa do Feijão project is currently under construction and is located in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, one of the windiest locations of Brazil. The long-term contracted debt facilities amount to 306 million of Brazilian Reais and its financial closing is subject to customary conditions. The execution of this agreement reflects EDPR financing strategy to contract long-term debt in local currency at competitive prices in order to mitigate the refinancing risk and to reduce the foreign exchange risk by having a natural hedge between revenues and costs. In December 2011, at the Brazilian energy A-5 auction, these four projects were awarded with 20-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) starting in January 2016.  41. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS USED The new standards and interpretations that have been issued and are already effective and that the Group has applied on its consolidated financial statements with significant impact are the following:  IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This standard introduces a new approach in determining which investments should be consolidated, replacing IAS 27 - Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 - Consolidation SPE. This standard establishes a single model to be applied in assessing the existence of control over subsidiaries, where an investor has control over a subsidiary when it is exposed, or has the right, to variable returns arising from its involvement in the subsidiary and has the ability to influence these returns because of the power over it. Additionally, was introduced the concept of "de facto control". The Group presents the impact from the adoption of this standard on note 39.  IFRS 11 - Joint Arrangements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IFRS 11 - Joint Arrangements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption.      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  227  This standard superseded IAS 31 - Interests in Joint Ventures and introduces several changes for accounting jointly controlled investments, the main aspect is the elimination of the option to consolidate joint ventures by the proportional method, being the equity method mandatory. The structure of a joint agreement ceases to be the main factor in determining the accounting model to adopt. The classification of a joint agreement requires the identification and evaluation of the structure, legal form of the contractual agreement and other facts and circumstances. The Group presents the impact from the adoption of this standard on note 39.  IFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2011, IFRS 12 - Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, being allowed its early adoption. The information disclosed has to help users of the financial statements evaluate the nature and risks associated with its interests in other entities and the effects of those interests on the financial statements. The main issues considered are as follows: - for the interests in subsidiaries, it should be disclosed: (i) the composition of the group; (ii) non-controlling interests; (iii) significant restrictions on the parent's ability to access or use the assets and settle the liabilities of its subsidiaries; (iv) the nature of, and changes in, the risks associated with interests in consolidated structured entities; and (v) changes in its ownership interest that did or did not result in a loss of control during the reporting period; - for the interests in joint arrangements and associates, it should be disclosed: (i) the nature, extent and financial effects of its interests in joint arrangements and associates, including information about contractual relationships with other parties; and (ii) the nature of, and the changes in, the associated risks with its interests in joint ventures and associates; - for the interests in unconsolidated structured entities, it should be disclosed: (i) the nature and the extent of its interests in unconsolidated structured entities; and (ii) the evaluation of the nature and changes in the risks associated with the interests in unconsolidated structured entities. The disclosures resulted from the adoption of this standard were made in the notes 5 and 18. The new standards and interpretations that have been issued and are already effective and that the Group has applied on its consolidated financial statements with no significant impact are the following:  IAS 28 (Amended) - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures;  IAS 32 (Amended) - Financial Instruments: Presentation -Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;  IAS 36 (Amended) - Impairment of Assets: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets;  IAS 39 (Amended) - Financial Instruments: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting;  Investment Entities - Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27. Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group  IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in November 2009, IFRS 9 - Financial instruments part I: Classification and measurement, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, being allowed its early adoption. This standard, changed in July 2014, has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard is included in the IASB's comprehensive project to replace IAS 39 and relates to issues of classification and measurement of financial assets. The main issues considered are as follows: - the financial assets can be classified in two categories: at amortised cost or at fair value. This decision will be made upon the initial recognition of the financial assets. Its classification depends on how the entity presents these financial assets and the contractual cash flows associated to each financial asset in the business; - debt instruments can only be measured at amortised cost when the contractual cash-flows represent only principal and interest payments, which means that it contains only basic loan features, and for which an entity holds the asset to collect the contractual cash flows. All the other debt instruments are recognised at fair value; - equity instruments issued by third parties are recognised at fair value with subsequent changes recognised in the profit and loss. However an entity could irrevocably select equity instruments at initial recognition for which fair value changes and the realised gain or loss are recognised in fair value reserves. Gains and losses recognised in fair value reserves cannot be recycled to profit and loss. This is a discretionary decision, and does not imply that all the equity instruments should be treated on this basis. The dividends received are recognised as income for the year; - the exemption that allows unquoted equity investments and related derivatives to be measured at cost, under IAS 39, is not allowed under IFRS 9;      Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   228 228  228           EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES · 2014 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS ENERGY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE  - changes in fair value attributable to own credit risk of financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss, shall be recognised in Other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value changes related to these financial liabilities shall be recognised through profit or loss. The amounts recognised in Other comprehensive income shall not be reclassified/transferred to profit and loss. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.  IFRS 11 (Amended) - Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in December 2014, IFRS 11 (Amended) Accounting for acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This amendment introduces guidance on accounting that should be made in the acquisition of participation in joint operations that qualifies as a business, by applying the principles of IFRS 3 - Business Combinations. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this amendments.  IFRS 15 - Revenue from the Contracts with Customers The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2014, IFRS 14 - Revenue from the Contracts with Customers, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This new standard applies only to contracts for the delivery of products or services, and requires an entity to recognize revenue when the contractual obligation to deliver assets or services is satisfied and the amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity is entitled, as provided in the "5 steps methodology". The 5 steps methodology consists in the following steps: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and (v) recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.  IAS 1 (Amended) - Initiative Disclosures The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in December 2014, IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment has not yet been adopted by the European Union. The following narrow scope amendments have been made to IAS1: - Materiality and aggregation: clarifies that an entity should not obscure useful information by aggregating our disaggregating information; and that materiality considerations apply to the primary statements, notes and any specific disclosure requirements in IFRSs, i.e. disclosures specifically required by IFRSs need to be provided only if the information is material; - Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income: clarifies that the list of line items specified by IAS 1 for these statements can be disaggregated as relevant. Additional guidance has been on the presentation of subtotals in these statements; - Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI"): clarifies that an entity's share of OCI of equity-accounted a in associates and joint ventures should be presented in aggregate as single line items based on whether or not it will subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss; - Notes: clarifies that entities have the flexibility when designing the structure of the notes and provides guidance on how to determine a systematic order of the notes. The Group is evaluating the impact of adopting this amendment. The standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group with no significant impact are the following:  IFRS 10 (Amended) and IAS 28 (Amended) - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture: no significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of these amendments;  IFRS 10 (Amended), IFRS 12 (Amended) and IAS 28 (Amended) - Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception: no significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of these amendments;  IFRS 14 - Regulatory Deferral Accounts: no significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this standard;  IAS 16 (Amended) and IAS 38 (Amended) - Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation: no significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of these amendments;      IFRIC 21 - Levies: no significant impact in the Group is expected from the adoption of this interpretation; Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15   EDP RENOVÁVEIS, S.A.

ENVIRONMENT ISSUES Expenses of environmental nature are the expenses that were identified and incurred to avoid, reduce or repair damages of an environmental nature that result from the Group's normal activity. These expenses are booked in the income statement of the year, except if they qualify to be recognised as an asset, according to IAS 16. During the year, the environmental expenses recognised in the income statement in the amount of 2,849 thousands of Euros (31 December 2013: 2,813 thousands of Euros) refer to costs with the environmental management plan. As referred in accounting policy 2o), the Group has established provisions for dismantling and decommissioning of property, plant and equipment when a legal or contractual obligation exists to dismantle and decommission those assets at the end of their useful lives. Consequently, the Group has booked provisions for property, plant and equipment related to electricity wind generation for the responsibilities of restoring sites and land to its original condition, in the amount of 96,676 thousands of Euros as at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: 62,461 thousands of Euros) (see note 30).  43. OPERATING SEGMENTS REPORT The Group generates energy from renewable resources and has three reportable segments which are the Group's business platforms, Europe, North America and Brazil. The strategic business units have operations in different geographic zones and are managed separately because their characteristics are quite different. For each of the strategic business units, the Group's CEO reviews internal management reports on at least a quarterly basis. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as described in note 3. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included in Annex 2. Performance is based on segment operating profit measures, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Management. Segment operating profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis.

Access roads are constructed for long-term use and built to accommodate heavy equipment and maintenance vehicles throughout the life of the project. Cash-Flow Amount of cash generated and used by a company in a given period. Cash flow can be used as an indication of a company's financial strength. EPS Earnings per share.   The portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.  Asset Rotation Strategy aimed at crystallising the value of a project by selling a minority stake in an asset and reinvesting the proceeds in another asset, targeting greater growth.  Curtailment The forced shut-down of some or all of the wind turbine generators within a wind farm to mitigate issues associated with turbine loading export to the grid, or certain planning conditions. Curtailment is controlled by the regional transmission operator.  Equity Consolidation Accounting process of treating equity investments, in associate companies. Equity account is usually applied where the entity holds 20-50% of voting stock.  Availability The percentage of time a wind turbine is technically available to capture the wind resource and convert it to electricity.  Dividend Pay-out Ratio Measures the percentage of a company's net income that is given to shareholders in the form dividends. (Total Annual Dividends per Share / Earnings per Share).  Feed in Tariffs Remuneration framework that guarantees that a company will receive a set price from their utility, applied to all of the electricity they generate and provide to the grid.  Blades The large "arms" of wind turbines that extend from the hub of a generator. Most turbines have either two or three blades. Wind blowing over the blades causes the blades to "lift" and rotate.  Dividend Policy Set of guidelines a company uses to decide how much of its earnings it will pay out to shareholders.  Financial Investment An asset in which to put money into with the expectation of obtaining gains or an appreciation in to a larger sum of money.  Capex Capital Expenditure. Funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings or equipment (ex: construction of wind farms).  EBITDA An accounting measure calculated using a company's net earnings, before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization are subtracted, as a proxy for a company's current operating profitability.  Forex The market in which currencies are traded.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) A heavy colourless gas that does not support combustion, dissolves in water to form carbonic acid, is formed especially in animal respiration and in the decay or combustion of animal and vegetable matter, is absorbed from the air by plants in photosynthesis, and is used in the carbonation of beverages.  ENEOP (Eólicas de Portugal) A consortium created to win a wind energy tender in 2005-2006. The bid was designed to promote renewable energy as part of an industrial policy whereby all the steps form turbines design to operation would be located in Portugal. ENEOP won the first and biggest exploitation license at 1,335 MW, of which EDPR holds a 40% economic interest (533 MW).  Greenhouse gases Gases that trap the heat of the sun in the Earth's atmosphere, producing the greenhouse effect; the two major greenhouse gases are water vapour and carbon dioxide; lesser greenhouse gases include methane, ozone, chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrogen oxides.  Gross Profit An accounting measure calculated using a company's revenue minus its cost of goods sold. Gross profit is a company's residual profit for selling a product or service and deducting the cost associated with its production and sale.  CorporateRegister.com Limited 22-05-15       GW Unit of electric power equal to one billion watts, one thousand megawatts (MW). Watts are the yardstick for measuring power.

Net Capacity Factor (NCF) The ratio of a plant's actual output over a period of time, to its potential output if it were possible for it to operate at full nameplate capacity continuously over the same period of time. Also known as Load Factor.  Renewable Energy Energy that is derived from resources that are regenerative or that cannot be depleted including wind energy, solar, biomass, geothermal, and moving water. Also known as alternative energy.  Installed Capacity Capacity installed and ready to produce energy.  Net Debt A metric that shows a company's overall debt situation calculated using company's total debt less cash on hand.  Renewable Energy Credits (REC) A REC represents the property rights to the environmental, social, and other non-power qualities of renewable electricity generation. A REC can be sold separately from the electricity associated with a renewable energy generation source.  LEAN A production philosophy that considers the expenditure of resources in any aspect other than the direct creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination.  Net Investment Equals (Capex + Financial investments ­ Financial divestments).  Watt (W) The rate of energy transfer equivalent to one ampere under an electrical pressure of one volt. One watt equals 1/746 horsepower, or one joule per second. It is the product of voltage and current (amperage).  Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) Levelized cost of electricity provides a common way to compare the cost of energy across technologies. LCOE takes into account the installed system price and associated costs such as financing, land, insurance, transmission, operation and maintenance, and depreciation. The LCOE is a true apples-to-apples comparison of electricity costs and is the most common measure used by electric utilities or purchasers of power to evaluate the financial viability and attractiveness of a wind energy project.  Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) A legal contract between an electricity generator (provider) and a power purchaser (host).The power purchaser buys energy, and sometimes also capacity and/or ancillary services, from the electricity generator.  Wind energy Power generated by converting the mechanical energy of the wind into electrical energy through the use of a wind generator.  Production Tax Credit (PTC) The result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, a commercial tax credit that applies to wholesale electrical generators of wind energy facilities based upon the amount of energy generated in a year.  Wind farm Wind farm is used in reference to the land, wind turbine generators, electrical equipment, and transmission lines for the purpose of generating wind energy and alternative energy.
